  PRC_rc2.1.t: "The Fall of the Military Government"
  PRC_rc2.1.d: "On the waters of Lake Burley Griffin, red flags rippled in reflection while the growl of armored engines shredded the quiet of dawn.\n\nFrom the moment he woke, Kalia had been on edge. Truth be told, he hadn’t known a calm minute since the Pacific Defense Treaty capitulated. The headlines of recent days only fed the panic:\n\n“ALL JAPANESE WAR CRIMINALS HAVE BEEN TRIED.”\n\nIt was today’s lead. The more he stared, the redder the letters seemed to bleed; for a moment he could almost smell iron and blood.\n\nHis wife set the breakfast tray down—cutlery chimed and he flinched. Even a tender, perfectly seared steak turned to leather in his mouth. The fear of reckoning lodged like a bone in his throat: Japan had been dealt with; would they be next? Reason told him the CCP wouldn’t come for him yet—the big fish in the junta still swam, and a mere lieutenant general like him wouldn’t be first in the net. But what if? What if they especially hated white men? What if something he’d said had rubbed some Chinese the wrong way?\n\nHe fretted through to afternoon. When the envelope finally appeared on his desk, the crimson seal on the cover made its origin plain. He rubbed his face, steeled himself, and tore open the kraft packet.\n\nKalia read the formal Chinese prose line by line as if both hunting for something and terrified to find it. One page, two, three… His eyes froze near the end of the penultimate page. No name. Not his name, at least. His spine, wound like a cable, eased by a notch.\n\nForcing himself on, he reached the last paragraph: “Former Australian Military Government lieutenant general and Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Kalia Williams: no crimes substantiated during wartime; conduct postwar has been satisfactory; cooperation positive; relevant professional experience recognized. Upon review, you are hereby appointed acting minister of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and pastoral affairs in the Australian Provisional Government. Discharge your duties faithfully.”\n\nThe document slipped from his fingers. Only then did it occur to him to look at the title stamped across the first page…"

  PRC_rc2.2.t: "Everything to Rebuild"
  PRC_rc2.2.d: "Two crescent rips at the knees of his work pants were caked with the rusty dust of Sydney’s sandstone. Ash fell from his fingers in the direction of a police cruiser, speckling the paint where his eyes rested.\n\nHow many junkies had they hauled in this month? Marli had lost count. He did remember this was the eighth one he’d tipped off. Why not? You report the white parasites and get paid.\n\nHe crushed the butt under a dark fingertip and watched the cruiser pull away. Yes—he was an Aboriginal man: no neat census label, no single tribal name, because their names—Kuli, Wunawal, Guli, Muli, and so many others—had been systematically erased. They were the people of this land long before colonists came; the people systematically oppressed for centuries; the people who helped the Chinese army come ashore.\n\nSydney had been prosperous before the war—but never for him. Injustice in the courts, bias in hospitals and schools, discrimination in hiring… he’d long since learned to hate the junta. So when the Chinese reached out, he’d taken the deal—became a “turncoat,” an “Aussie traitor,” as they spat.\n\nAt first he didn’t think much better of the Chinese than of the whites. Helping was a way to make the latter choke. But as the junta was broken up and reconstruction moved, he couldn’t deny the difference: the equality they failed to win in a century was hammered into place in three months. From then on, anti-discrimination slogans stopped being just slogans. From then on, his name started showing up on the voluntary overtime list.\n\nHe stood, brushed the dust from his jacket, and looked back at the freshly poured foundation. In his mind he saw the skyline to come—towers for all the people of Australia.\n\nProsperity in chains had crumbled. The isolated continent was free at last."

  PRC_rc2.3.t: "Death of an Old Army Doctor"
  PRC_rc2.3.d: "Tanaka Ichirō was complaining again to his father about Grandfather’s paranoia. He had just finished cleaning the room; now it was a wreck.\n\n“Your grandfather used to be open and warm,” his father said after a long pause. “He studied medicine. After graduating he treated many in our hometown—poor folk who couldn’t afford a doctor—and made a name for himself. That, ironically, got him drafted into the Army. He went to China, saw things… and came back this way.”\n\nFatigue weighed on his father’s face; the crease between his brows seemed to lock away his strength. Ichirō dropped the questions and thought instead of how kindly the neighbors treated their family and how concerned they were for Grandfather. Perhaps Father was right. Even so, the old man’s nerves had brought plenty of trouble—shouting in the dead of night, lashing out at passersby. The neighbors always said they didn’t mind, that they understood, but the constant apologies wore them down, and guilt gnawed, too.\n\nIn the end, the trouble faded with the old man’s passing. Before he died he sent everyone out and kept only his eldest son to hear his last words, to the aunts’ displeasure. Afterward, Father never said much about what was said. He simply followed Grandfather’s instructions and divided the estate. Life went on."
  PRC_rc2.3.a: "So why does the heart still pound with dread?"

  PRC_rc2.4.t: "Rebirth of a People"
  PRC_rc2.4.d: "From that day, Father grew ever more silent. Eventually a doctor called it mild paranoia.\n\nAt first Ichirō blamed grief. But on reflection, it wasn’t just that. Father’s brow had been knotted for years, and never seemed to unclench. His body weakened as the seasons turned. Same room, same bed, different man. At the end, Father’s fists stayed tight and the crease remained. Father met Ichirō’s eyes, just as he had met his own father’s.\n\n“These photos and documents… keep them safe,” he rasped. “They are the atrocities your grandfather… cough… saw with his own eyes.”\n\nThe pictures were so vile they dragged Ichirō’s gaze to them again and again. His brow, too, stopped relaxing.\n\n“You know what kind of man your grandfather was. When he watched comrades’ faces twist as they committed one crime after another… ah… the barracks were full of brutes. He could do little. For our sake, he kept his head down and endured.” Father’s voice trembled. “Luckily he had a camera—and the chance to keep a record…”\n\n“After the defeat he was sent home quickly for ‘good behavior.’ He tried to hand the material to the international tribunal, but everyone entrusted with it died—each in some ‘accident.’ For safety he gave up. Before he died he gave them to me, and now I give them to you. Ichirō, look after your mother and the younger ones, hide these and hold them. When the time comes, atone—for your grandfather, and for our nation…”\n\nThree days later, Father was gone. Ichirō’s brow has never eased since.\n\nAfter the funeral, he went to a hidden corner and studied the cache. The photos sickened him; the documents’ crimes against humanity pointed straight at the Emperor. He thought a long time, then swore an oath: he would keep the truth—remember it and pass it on, as his father and grandfather had done. The secret would stay with the Tanaka family until the day it could see the light.\n\n…\n\nTimes changed; clouds gathered; flames rose.\n\nHe stared at the nearby PLA post, still hesitant. What if…\n\nAfter a moment’s pacing he clenched the bundle in his hand, stepped forward—and then another step."

  PRC_rc2.5.t: "“Justice”? Justice."
  PRC_rc2.5.d: "Clack—clatter… An empty beer can bounced off the wall and rattled to a stop, leaving bright stains on the floor.\n\nKim Jae-u was sure Korea was finished—had been for years: chaebols running rampant, cults everywhere, sin without number. As a young man he’d once believed the courts could set the country right. That dream had turned him into a joke.\n\nHe didn’t mind being a joke. Korea was the biggest joke of all—America’s self-catering lapdog, only to be ground under by the very nation and ideology it had despised.\n\n“Justice will never come,” he muttered. “It never came in the first place—and strongman rule will drive it from the peninsula forever.” He mumbled and sulked and drifted to sleep in the amber pool of a desk lamp.\n\n…\n\nCrisp footsteps echoed down the corridor of the temporary courthouse; the warmth of sunset flowed over a Zhongshan suit.\n\nHow long had he slept? An hour? Half? It didn’t matter. Feeling the weight of the case file in his hands, he was more awake than he had ever been.\n\nThe ember for justice in his chest had never gone out—only drowned beneath a black tide. When a letter of appointment came from the East Asian Defense Initiative; when the first wrongful conviction was overturned; when the first cult was crushed… when that black tide began to ebb and a spark called justice glinted again, the boy who had longed for fairness returned.\n\nHe still saw the chaebols’ crimes; he knew the filth of the cults; he remembered the peninsula’s sins. Days on end with files didn’t tire him; insults in court didn’t pierce the skin; even the North’s reserve couldn’t cool his zeal. Because he saw tears when grievances were redressed; he heard the howls when evil met its due; he foresaw a future where right prevailed…"

  PRC_rc2.6.t: "“My” Liberation"
  PRC_rc2.6.d: "He sank into the sofa, exhausted, the man with the ambition-slicked haircut awash in thoughts: the South was liberated—his father’s and grandfather’s vow fulfilled; sanctions were gone—the people could finally live better; aid was on the way—antique machinery could be replaced; October was near—time to prepare for Beijing…\n\nHe stared into the sunset. There was too much to handle, too much to ponder, too much to negotiate. A rare young face among the world’s leaders, he bore pressures a thousand times those of his peers.\n\nSuch is the tragedy of a small state: the DPRK can take neither a false step nor a sideways one. One mistake could mean the abyss.\n\nHe was the leader of Korea, the sun of the peninsula, the great General—but never himself. They called him leader, general, dictator, the third sun—but almost no one called him “Jong-un.” He rubbed the corner of his eye, sprang to his feet, and summoned his guard and his secretary. Soon a Maybach was winding toward Brothers Hill.\n\nThe bumpy mountain road made him a little dizzy; the secretary’s questions pricked his temper. Yes, the martyrs’ ceremony was tomorrow. Yes, there was a meeting with experts from Dandong tonight. But he had to go—had to see the old man, had to talk.\n\n…\n\nThe guards and secretary stayed with the car. He alone stood before the grave. Step by step he reached the stone and laid his palms on its clean, rough face—as he had years ago. The tears he’d held back then finally broke free, soaking the yellow earth he had once shoveled with his own hands. A dry leaf had come to rest on his shoulder.\n\n“Uncle… can you see? Jong-un did it… Jong-un did it…” He had so much to say; so little came out. He stood before Hyon Chol-hae’s grave until the tears stopped and his hands steadied.\n\nThe sun was dropping. He couldn’t be willful any longer. The Korean people were waiting; the other EADI leaders were waiting; it wasn’t time to lay down the load.\n\nHe stamped feeling back into his numb legs and turned down the slope. With one last glance he could almost swear the photo on the stone was smiling…"

  PRC_rc2.7.t: "Catching Up Before the Parade"
  PRC_rc2.7.d: "Tick-tock. The wall clock kept time while a neatly uniformed soldier fussed with his kit, getting ready for today’s victory parade. He picked up the frame on the table and stroked it: two comrades shoulder to shoulder. The man on the left was broad-shouldered; the other, wirier.\n\nThe door opened. He turned and snapped a salute.\n\n“Good morning, Company Commander!”\n\n“At ease, Wang. How’s prep?” “All ready, sir—always ready to be reviewed by the Party and the people.” “Good. You’re the face of our company out there. Keep your bearing—don’t lose us points.”\n\nThe commander glanced at the photo. “Still thinking about Zhang? I know you two were like brothers. But war is cruel. The PLA are not immortals; there are casualties.” Wang’s head dipped. “But there’s good news. Zhang’s nearly recovered. When he heard you’d be on the parade ground for us, he begged a phone call.”\n\nWang lifted the receiver. A familiar voice crackled through: “Hello—hello? Anyone? Weird—must be the signal.”\n\n“Zhang…”\n\n“Loud and clear now. Lucky dog—representing the company! Keep your posture sharp, you hear? I’m going to brag all over the ward.”\n\n“Oh, listen to you. We were supposed to march together. You and your lack of discipline—risking your life for that Japanese girl. When you staggered back with her and went down at the line—scared me half to death. I carried you to the field hospital on my back, telling you the whole way not to sleep. You promised after this fight you’d go home and sleep for a week. You owe me a life, you know.”\n\n“Anyone would’ve saved her. We’re the people’s army. Japan is our enemy—but their people are innocent, dragged into the abyss by fanatics. And as for you squeezing me for favors—forget it!” The commander and the political instructor traded a smile as the two young men bantered.\n\nThe commander checked his watch. “All right—enough catching up. Formation soon. Off you go, Wang.”\n\n“Go get ’em, big guy—bring honor to the company!”\n\n“Sir!” Wang saluted and headed for the assembly area…"
  PRC_rc2.7.a: "The PLA stands not only for the Chinese people, but for all who love peace"
  
  PRC_rc2.8.t: "Day of Action"
  PRC_rc2.8.d: "Since the late 19th century, Japan’s ambitions swelled without cease. Under the bayonets of Japanese militarists, Asia bled; during the Second World War, Imperial troops committed crimes that left victims living the rest of their lives in fear and pain. We once watered Japan with goodwill and civilization; in return, that soil bore fruit in the suffering of Asia’s peoples. A motion to hold modern Japanese militarists, right-wing forces, and other Pacific Defense Treaty (PDT) perpetrators to account was rushed through the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress—and the arrests began at once.\n\nBecause resistance remnants in various PDT states had not been fully rooted out, PLA combat units took on this phase of the arrests. IFVs howled through streets and along highways toward safehouses scattered across former PDT territory. The safehouse list was thanks to an intelligence officer’s fatal “dereliction”: while relocating a file safe he tried to hose down a PLA assault team with an SMG—only to be reduced to charcoal by a handheld flamethrower.\n\nCivilians and politicians who had long organized right-wing activity across regions were rounded up. In Hokkaidō, Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi; Diet member Seiichi Etō; and LDP Foreign Affairs Division chief Masahisa Satō were all taken. The liner carrying Etō was intercepted by a destroyer in the Kuril Islands; after a futile struggle he was dragged—bruised and bloodied—onto a helicopter. More rightists and a long list of former PDT war criminals were being transferred to the detention facilities of the Asia–Pacific Special Military Tribunal.\n\nOnly in a few places did things veer off plan: a band of ex-officers styling themselves a “Assault Detachment” attempted suicide-bomb attacks on an arrest team; with drone ISR cueing, an IFV’s autocannon cut the bombers in half. In Chennai, Indian Army Chief Manoj Mukund Naravane—months in hiding—caught a rifle butt to the ribs and sobbed on the bench of the speeding transport. Elsewhere, soldiers hog-tied [JapMinister] and tossed him in front of a garrison tank’s tracks—so terrified he lost control of his bladder."
  PRC_rc2.8.a: "So much for your vaunted Bushidō."

  PRC_rc2.9.t: "The Trial Opens"
  PRC_rc2.9.d: "From 1946 to 1948, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East sat in Tokyo to try Class-A war criminals. Yet that tribunal never brought Asia the fairness and justice it deserved. Many Japanese defendants pleaded “not guilty,” even recasting invasion, massacre, and bombing as a “big brother disciplining a disobedient little brother.” In the face of tens of millions of Asian dead, and for reasons that included containing socialist states and acquiring Japanese research, the U.S.-led tribunal excluded Emperor Hirohito, Shiro Ishii, Unit 731, and many others from indictment.\n\nHistory, however, renders its verdict in the end. After the Great Asian War, the East Asian Defense Initiative (EADI), duly authorized, immediately established a Special Military Tribunal. Prosecutors from all countries unanimously resolved to file a public indictment covering all war crimes committed by PDT member regimes and their armed forces during the Great Asian War and World War II. Although most Imperial officers of general rank are long dead, the nations will prosecute Japan as a state for its 20th-century crimes—as beneficiary of aggression and as the authority that sanctioned slaughter. This is the least we can do for the souls of the dead.\n\nJapan’s crimes are by the thousands and tens of thousands; statistics and standards across countries differ widely; and years of domestic hostility propaganda have had their effect. Countless Japanese officers behaved outrageously at capture (they are housed in war-criminal detention, not the better-conditioned POW camps for ordinary PDT soldiers). The court thus faces a mountain of files.\n\nAt the rear gate of the Special Tribunal, a column of army trucks stretched out of sight—their cargo: PDT war criminals. Journalists could scarcely capture a face; angry citizens at the gate had already peppered the convoy with eggs. Judge Hao, on loan from the Supreme People’s Court to preside, couldn’t help but sigh. Even with his experience, the scale of the day left him anxious. He turned to the EADI judges and, solemn, said:\n\n“Colleagues of the bench: here and now, we bear on our shoulders billions of lives, tens of millions of wronged souls, and a century of the world’s grief. We must proceed from fact and stand on law, uphold the dignity of human conscience with the utmost seriousness of the judiciary. Our motherlands, our peoples, hope that today…” He paused."
  PRC_rc2.9.a: "No one escapes; no crime goes unpunished."

  PRC_rc2.92.t: "The Gavel Falls"
  PRC_rc2.92.d: "With AI-assisted analysis and integrated databases, the files were organized in short order; improved procedures meant the Special Tribunal—and the public—did not have to wait two years as after WWII. Fifteen days sufficed.\n\nDuring trial, several former civilian officials and right-wing leaders insisted, “Japan and our partners merely meant to ‘discipline’ aggressive China—we are innocent.” The gallery scarcely heckled; what came instead were weary, contemptuous snorts. Most ex-PDT officers and right-wing participants, by contrast, accepted the charges calmly; many fawned and grovelled, scrambling to name one another—and their subordinates—for looting and rape of civilians during the Great Asian War in hopes of shaving their sentences.\n\nAs for sentences beyond the Emperor’s case, the results spoke for themselves. Former prime minister [JapMinister]; Joint Staff Chief Nagumo Kenichirō; Army Central Area Commander Yamashita Hirotaka; Navy Kure District Commander Futagawa Tatsuya; Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi; Indian Army Chief Manoj Mukund Naravane; Australian Liberal Party leader Scott Morrison; and 129 others from former PDT governments, militaries, and civic groups were sentenced to death. A further 946 received prison terms from 15 months to 25 years, with tight limits on commutation. As punishment for Japan’s 20th-century crimes, symbols and monuments of militarism across the country will be removed, and the former Japanese government is required to issue written apologies and compensation to registered victims and their heirs. Japan and other PDT states are further liable for substantial reparations; at the same time, the sham Western-style “democracy” of the past is to be abolished and broad popular participation instituted.\n\nUpon hearing his death sentence, Yoshida Keishū smashed his fist into the back of [JapMinister]’s head, calling him a “spineless shrimp.” Predictably, most of those sentenced to death appealed. Equally predictably, the second-instance verdicts did not change."

  PRC_rc2.93.t: "Sentencing the “Emperor”"
  PRC_rc2.93.d: "“As former head of state of Japan, the defendant led his country headlong during the Asian War of Liberation and bears direct responsibility for the creation and expansion of the reactionary ‘Pacific Defense Treaty.’ He dispatched troops to obstruct the Korean people’s liberation and personally took part in propaganda for the old Empire’s militarism and fascism, while indulging—and even aiding—the growth of right-wing and far-right political and paramilitary organizations at home. His crimes violate public law, offend moral law, and defy human feeling; they tore through the boundaries of international law, challenged the bottom line of peaceful development, and trampled the red lines of regional security. In accordance with international law, and in view of the allocation of decision-making power and responsibility in the former Japanese system, the Court rules as follows:”\n\n“Defendant Naruhito, guilty of crimes against peace and war crimes: combined punishment for multiple offenses, sentenced to—”"

  PRC_rc2.10.d: "With the last wisp of powder smoke torn away by the wind, peace returned to East Asia. Led by the Communist Party, great socialist China—hand in hand with EADI partners—prevailed. The region’s great reactionary forces were scoured away; only scattered diehards remained. The chapter of revival reaches its period. We now stand proudly at the summit of the world.\n\nYet every revolutionary storm brings damage that cannot be avoided. In a war that swallowed months and years, flames consumed the ocean’s former prosperity; the waters themselves glowed red—and that false dawn has not entirely faded. Whose bones lie under Tokyo’s broken walls? Whose blood dried in Sydney’s ruins? Whose hunger crawls in Delhi’s foul pits? What filth is buried beneath Seoul’s foundations? No one can answer.\n\nThe guilty are about to meet, or have already met, their end. But the innocent live on in ruin. After fire comes upheaval; upheaval brings chaos and death. Convoys pour in supplies, yet cannot fill the hole in order; lives keep slipping away. Civilians of the defeated wear blank faces, live in dread, or stew in gloom. Poisoned by reactionary rule, they fear for life and future—or claw for survival. This is not what we wish to see. The bitter fruit planted by reactionaries is being eaten by the people.\n\nHowever unwelcome, it is the truth; however painful, it is the present. We will not flinch; we will not relent. We will hold fast to a community with a shared future for humankind—and live our ideals.\n\nPeople of the Asia–Pacific…"

  PRC_rc2.11.d: "Since the drug-legalization bill passed, Melbourne had changed: addicts on every corner, spent needles everywhere. He put on the shell necklace his daughter gave him and his old uniform. Jack still walked the beat, never slacking—yet everything got worse. The pressure was a Tasman gale; he was nearly swamped. But for Amy, he kept going.\n\nWar came anyway. The junta conscripted police to bolster Korea; of course he couldn’t dodge it. He and Amy talked for hours before he left. At the gate he said it again and again: “Stay away from those bastards—and the damned smack… wait for me.” It was all he could give.\n\nDust scatters with the wind; what of men? He did his best—no use. From Seoul to Daejeon, then Busan: lose and lose again. One in ten left standing, bodies everywhere—and they never even saw the real enemy.\n\nSlumped against the bulkhead, he stared at the half a left leg he had left. Look on the bright side, he told himself: at least I’m going home.\n\nAn empty house. Cold stone. The shell’s sharp edge bit his palm; drops of blood fell before the two headstones. There was no one left to comfort him.\n\nShe was gone—overdose. He hated—oh, he hated—the scum who dragged her down; the government cowards who let the poison spread; the teachers who looked away… He hated most of all that he hadn’t protected her.\n\nMore than once he clenched the pistol in his teeth—and each time his old partner batted it away. Bill said this wasn’t his way to go.\n\nWhat happened after? China won? He didn’t care. Damn the world, damn Australia, damn it all… He kept cursing everything, as if words alone could flay those animals alive. He knew it wouldn’t help—but he couldn’t stop.\n\nBorders don’t feel parting and return; hearts do. That night Jack and Bill drank themselves blind—for one reason only: the dealers and the scum were gone, cut down by the new government. He polished his badge for the first time in years.

  PRC_rc2.12.d: "Engines roared; dust rose. After years on ice, the Alpha coal mine finally spun up. Along with it came some 300 kilometers of new rail and a deep-water port.\n\nOrlando watched the crews cheering and felt a mix of things. He’d been here in 2017, too—same site teams, same shaft surveys. Different was his title: now chief geologist. Different, too, that the Indians never broke ground back then.\n\nHe could understand why GVK walked away: a coal deposit that only made sense after tens of billions of dollars in port and rail? He wouldn’t have touched it either. The Chinese, though, seemed to think differently.\n\nWas the director surnamed Liu—Liu, or Liao? He’d forgotten. But he remembered what “Mr. Liu” said: projects that lift people’s livelihoods must be pursued without reservation. Not long after that, the port, the rails, and the pit before him were all under construction. A thousand direct jobs, tens of thousands indirect. Queensland’s economy was breathing again.\n\nOrlando didn’t pretend to grasp the jargon—nationalization, collectivization, public ownership—but taking the Chinese team’s lead had plainly improved local life. And he was back to his real work, not mapping trenches at gunpoint.\n\nHe rubbed his temples—no use overthinking it. The more you think, the less it makes sense. If it meant ditching the junta’s thugs and letting him do what he loved, he’d take a new government—or an alien one. He jogged over, squatted with the crew, chewed his boxed lunch, and let his mind roam to what’s next: uranium in South Australia, shale gas in the Northern Territory, a super copper deposit in WA—treasures past governments shelved for cost or tech. Now, their real owners were about to meet them.\n\nHe swallowed a bite of fried chicken and glanced up at the sun—then raised his soda in a little toast. No one knew to whom."

  PRC_rc2.13.d: "Feeling the weight of the iron pick in his hands, stomping his feet, rubbing his eyes—Soma finally convinced himself this wasn’t a dream. He’d had his eye on this “refugee camp” for some time. Not to rob or kill—just to slip in and become one of them.\n\n“Camp” was a misnomer; the people there looked more like laborers hired by the soldiers. There were neat prefab cabins and blankets, three flatbreads a day, and sometimes even meat. And this was the treatment for Dalits? The moment he saw the meals they gave those workers, he decided this had to be the northern paradise the village elders spoke of. He tried all sorts of schemes—like blending in when they came into the forest to fell trees—but his rags were so tattered he would be spotted at once, and he dared not gamble on the consequences. Five days of sleeping rough later, he’d made no progress at all. Then this morning, he woke to find their camp expanding right to the tree he was perched in. The moment he climbed down, soldiers surrounded him and took him for processing. With another Dalit acting as interpreter, he completed a physical and hygiene check, then was sent to bathe. After that…\n\nHere he was, clean clothes on his back and a pick in his arms. The interpreter said from tomorrow he’d be with a work party grading land for more prefab housing. Since there were many displaced laborers, the camp ran on rations: food was issued at fixed times and places each day, and wages settled weekly. Other assignments would depend on PLA needs. He looked at his clean hands—the first time in years—rubbed the polyester of his new jacket, and glanced over at the pot stewing mutton curry.\n\nHe was certain: this was paradise."

Watching the crimson flag draw near over the water, the man couldn’t help but snap his fingers.\n\nHow long since his last job—two years, three? Leaning over the bow rail, he replayed the time since. His firm was small, just two freighters, but with friends in China he’d done all right. Then the junta came: ships gone, cargo gone—requisitioned for war. He was lucky to be in China and not thrown in with the rest.\n\nHe often kicked himself: why hadn’t he run the fleet to a neutral port in advance? Half his wealth vanished. Fortune of sorts: the ships weren’t destroyed in the war, and when EADI liquidated the junta’s assets afterward, they were returned to him. With what savings he had, he restarted the company. But the mines, UXO, and wrecks the junta left behind sealed the lanes like an iron barrel. He kept eating through his savings until word finally came: channels cleared.\n\nHe raised the binoculars: spotless skies, no storm clouds, no lightning, no contrails of missiles and fighters. Everything was back: the long run of foul weather gone, the perilous lanes open, the smoke of battle dispersed.

The older man crushed his cigarette under heel and let the surf worry at his thoughts; the young man looked skyward, warm wind stroking his rising joy.\n\nA long sigh broke the quiet. The student turned to meet those narrowed eyes again.\n\n“Gyunchŏng, what’s your thinking now?”\n\nCui Gyunchŏng’s lips twitched. “Mm… that the country is finally one—and people can live well. Also, sir, the stacks of paperwork in your office are truly something.”\n\n“You brat—dodging again.” Pak Sucheong shook his head and pulled a sheet from his coat. “Look this over. Then answer me again.”\n\nThe student took it and spread it flat. Names, row on row.\n\n“You’re still unsure about using them?”\n\n“Yes. They worked for the Southern puppets. I can’t rest easy.”\n\nA cable had arrived a few days earlier, authorizing reform and opening in Incheon—and with it, his worry. The North was manageable: familiar people, Chinese support; follow the plan and you won’t go far wrong. But the South? Mafias rampant, chaebols entrenched, the masses unfamiliar. For them and the Chinese experts alike, it was alien ground. Even a dragon from afar can’t always overawe the local snakes. At this rate, never mind reform—rebuilding alone would be a slog.\n\nThe situation was tangled and manpower short; without flexibility, progress would stall. Yet he feared seeding future risks—and so he hesitated, which is why he had asked for this talk by the sea.\n\n“If you ask me, use them—openly.”\n\nPak’s hand left his lighter and his gaze fixed on Cui. The student had a mind of his own, but this was the first time he’d answered so quickly.\n\n“Reason.”\n\n“I compiled the list. We have their records and their views; at worst they’re stubborn, set in their ways, and prejudiced against us. But they have skill—and a conscience.” He flicked the lighter and held the flame for his teacher, then turned back toward the water. “Which is why I think Comrade Qiu is right.”\n\nHis eyes followed the same line: sunlight cupped by the sea, dark cloud ferrying a kindly breeze; egrets at rest in green shadow, the red sun trading east for west. Broad without chaos, harmonious without sameness—vitality everywhere and all things striving. The world had never felt so wide. Yes—so it should be. Comrade Qiu was right."

A few web novels, a modest readership, a decent life. To some, he was just a clown who made a living by currying favor. He put away his notebook and sat on the curb, thinking of that “senior” who once told him, “Good writers must write with solemn depth.” He couldn’t help it—he laughed.\n\nHe thought the “must be solemn” talk was nonsense. But he did believe: a good work can’t ride a single hard line—whether beauty or pain. Just like the country he stood in now.\n\nHe’d visited Korea once before, a decade ago. No talking to residents; follow the guide; see only what they wanted him to see. Even so, the trip had given him material. And so he returned.\n\nHe saw Pyongyang after the war with his own eyes: joy at victory, confusion afterward, and today’s awkward groping forward. Joys and sorrows by the dozen: grieving mothers, returning soldiers, downcast stall-keepers, elated old farmers…\n\nThe old Korea was monotone—so much so that you could read a life from a face. But people change, and so do nations. He saw a former sentry boy frying skewers at a roadside stand; propaganda posters replaced by advertisements; jackets and denim unloaded from army trucks… He saw this young country fumbling toward its own path in its own way.\n\nHe recorded what he saw—good and ill—just as it was. No exaggeration; no sugar-coating.\n\nHe knew the type of hack who takes glee in tearing down what’s good and calls it “the art of regret”—malice passed off as art, like a clown picking at his own scab to trigger phantom pain in others. Painless groans, specious arguments, crowd-pleasing tricks—the stuff of ridicule.\n\nYu Xian wanted neither to spread malice nor to sing praises by rote.\n\n“What I want to tell is the story of living faces.”"

  PRC_rc2.18.d: "Seoul, South Korea. Kim Mi-young curled alone in a narrow flat. Autumn wind drove dead leaves to rap the yellowed panes; a fine rustle rimmed her ears. Her gaze was locked on the family portrait in her hands: a husband’s guileless smile; a son holding a trophy; sunlight on three faces. She looked to the window; the scene blurred; the smell of smoke seemed to creep in.\n\nThe war ruined everything. Her husband’s firm was crushed by punitive taxes; even copier paper was seized. She would never forget the moment a Samsung fixer slapped down that near-extortionate “agreement.” After that day, her husband seemed a different man—slumped on the couch, eyes glued to the TV, muttering. Later he took to the streets, leafleting and shouting about “Heaven’s scourge saving Korea.”\n\nThat night, she failed to stop him. He shoved her aside—left before their son came home—and went out clutching a booklet with a blood-red cross on the cover, muttering about “God’s will” and “divine punishment.” Five days later, she saw him again. Staring at the wedding band she had slid onto his finger with her own hands, she felt all strength leave her. Blood traced a line from under her nail.\n\n“Breaking news: the New Apocalypse sect carried out a mass self-immolation in central Seoul. Forty-seven dead.”\n\n…\n\nA husband burned, a son conscripted, savings drained, a home in pieces. Her boy, Lee Sang-min, had been her last pillar—swift as the wind, light and joyful. But the wind doesn’t outrun war. Once Seoul’s sprint champion and a youth-team prodigy—her pride—he was now a number at the front. Each morning she stood at the mailbox, hands shaking as she opened each envelope, praying it wasn’t the grey notice.\n\nThe war on the peninsula ended quickly. New leaves hung green; the earth breathed again. Children ran in the streets; crowds chattered at the soup trucks; the new government’s crews labored day and night. She sat alone in the empty flat, staring at the cult pamphlets her husband had left. “You bastard, Lee Jun-hee…” Her hoarse curse tangled with a sob; her fist stayed clenched.\n\nA breeze stirred the leaves; outside, the wind rose…"

  PRC_rc2.19.d: "In a sweater washed nearly white, clutching her husband’s “revelations,” Kim Mi-young stepped toward the new People’s Safety Committee office. Quiet street, quiet counter, simple steps that felt endless. She couldn’t recall the officer’s exact words, nor how she made it home. But the northern-accented promise—“We will handle this seriously”—she kept in her heart.\n\n“Cult ‘New Apocalypse’ dismantled; related trials begin today.” Same city, same station, same subjects—different story. She stood in the gallery and fixed her eyes on the man in the orange prison suit. The once-arrogant poser now raved at the judge like a mad dog. She took in the spectacle—and felt only silence inside. When the gavel fell, a tear burst at her shoe.\n\nThe wind still blew; the warm breath could not yet soothe her grief. Back home, she kicked aside the trash, polished her son’s trophy to a shine, folded her husband’s old clothes. Then she sat on the bed, staring blankly at the green leaves outside the window. Looking around the little home of twenty years, she remembered it all: a child’s crayon scribbles, a chair her husband repaired, the piles of garbage from these last months.\n\nSilence—suffocating silence—closed in. What road lay ahead? How would she live? She didn’t know.\n\n“Ding-dong—” The doorbell chimed. Numb, she shuffled to the door. The handle turned; the door swung. Her pupils tightened; her body trembled. Those eyes—unmistakable. She stared at the young soldier on the threshold, weather-worn face, different uniform, but the same eyes. Without a word, mother and son held each other tight.\n\nSunset warmed the streets under reconstruction; the breeze still carried the laughter of children. The peninsula and its people were savoring a precious peace."

  PRC_rc2.21.d: "The dust was settling, the smoke of war thinning. Amid the ruins of a Hokkaidō base, rows of tents had been raised. Over the still-intact gate hung a bilingual sign: “Labor & Skills Training Center.”\n\nOne hand propping his head, face clouded with worry—that was Saika’s state now. He’d been lucky enough not to make the front, but not so lucky as to avoid demobilization.\n\nThirty-two days—how many skills had he learned? Seven? Eight? Tailoring to baking, Monday through Saturday, dawn till dusk—class after class. PT at reveille, then training straight through to six, save an hour for lunch. Even after dinner there were two hours of civics. Grueling? Compared to this, the old drills had been easy.\n\nAnd yet he felt a fullness he hadn’t felt in years. The barebones, repetitive “training” and the endless war propaganda had long since sickened him.\n\nThose so-called drills were useless. “Elites” and militia alike were beaten a hundred times in a hundred tries—only the margin differed. No meaning, no hope, no future: that’s what the SDF looked like to him.\n\nDay after day the fortifications grew while the fog in his heart thickened. He no longer knew what picking up a rifle meant. Defend the nation? But Japan had started the war. Protect the people? The civilians’ eyes said only loathing. Fulfill a dream? What dream could he possibly have…\n\nA weapon in the hand, an empty head—that was what “one hundred million to sacrifice” looked like. He had no right to mock them; he’d been one of them. And yet… as he raised his eyes to the instructor on the platform, Saika straightened a little.\n\nHe still didn’t know when—or for what—he ought to fight. But…\n\n“At least now I know why I shouldn’t.”\n\nThe lecture rolled on; the instructor’s voice flowed: “One day some of you may take up arms again. When that day comes, I believe…”"

  PRC_rc2.26.d: "The Ganges’ first ripples rode the monsoon wind; a faint scent of masala hung in the air. Dawn mist had not yet lifted, and Supna was already crouched at the “stove”—really just stones set round a fire pit, an old clay pot balanced above damp kindling, a rusted saw blade stuck in the earth beside it. Crude—but it was most of what they owned for cooking.\n\nThe wet wood smoked, choking her until she had to turn her head—then back again, because the food in the pot could not be left. On the straw mat in the shack, Meena curled and coughed; her fever hadn’t broken. A few days ago the moneylenders had come early, taking every rupee and the black-market medicine Supna had bought. The due date was still half a year away…\n\nShe stared at the boiling chickpeas—the second-to-last handful. What remained would feed them only one more time. A rasp of pottery on wood, wet bare feet splashing through mud—Dipak was back.\n\n“The Brahmins are guarding the well…” He didn’t finish; he didn’t need to. Dalits weren’t allowed to draw water with Vaishyas. Everyone knew that.\n\nSupna looked at the water jar, barely three-fifths full, and sighed. This was a Dalit’s lot—she had always known it. Handing him the stirring stick, she wet a black cloth to cool their daughter’s brow. Meena’s cough had become a whimper. Pressing her forehead to her child’s fever-hot skin, she thought of Soma—their son.\n\nHad he made it across? Was he eating? Was he sick? Had he angered a high-caste lord… Questions piled on the back of a life already crushed by fate.\n\nDipak brought the chickpea mash, and the three of them bowed their heads to Shiva before they ate…"

Forced to detour to the river for water, he had become the village’s lone witness to the Brahmin’s flight.\n\nHe slapped his cheeks twice—hard—forced the tremor from his limbs, and stepped inside. “Shiva forgive me… Shiva forgive me…” he chanted as he rifled through the rooms. His low-caste hands defiled “sacred” things with every touch—damning him, he had been taught, to never rejoin the god after death. But if Meena were to live, there was no other way.\n\nDrawer after drawer, room after room—objects he’d never seen and had no use for. No medicine, no grain, not even water… The more he searched the madder he became, fear of the Brahmin forgotten, movements growing rough, frantic. He kicked doors open, yanked shelves bare—until, behind a glass cupboard, he found what he needed.\n\nThe kitchen had been left untouched. Loaves and other food still lay on the racks. He ripped down a curtain and stuffed in everything edible he could see, hands and mouth and feet all working at once. When his tongue was dry and his belly stretched and the makeshift bundle was full, he filled bottles with tap water from the sink, then staggered off toward the shack with his spoils.\n\n“Meena!

They had gone hungry for more than two days; aside from dirty puddle water and foraged roots, Meena had had nothing. The parents hadn’t had even that. Today Dipak had brought back real things—clear water, even—and enough to last a while. When the last bite was gone, Meena drifted to sleep. Supna stared at her husband as he knelt nearby, knocking his head to Brahma in thanks.\n\nThey had been plantation hands once, living on thin porridge and chickpeas doled out by the owner and a wage barely worth the name. Soma should have lived that life too. But the boy believed the elders’ tales of a “divine realm” to the north—and carried a pride no Dalit was supposed to. He’d clashed with a Kshatriya, lost an eye to a beating, and in fury fled north, leaving the parents to raise their young daughter alone. War and bandits followed, and high-caste militias ransacked the village again and again. Fewer jobs, worse pay—until the workshops and plantations around them simply vanished.\n\nShaking off the drift of memory, she bit into the bread. How she wished Soma could taste something this sweet. But he was far away now. Perhaps it was better that way. If he still lived, perhaps he had already reached that “divine realm.” She tucked the half-loaf back under the mat and knelt beside Dipak to pray—that in the next life they might be born Vaishya…"

Under the night’s shroud he saw misery: why had his beautiful homeland become this? Were his parents and sister safe? Rubbing his one good eye, Soma felt panic surge.\n\nTwo years earlier he had crossed into Assam—no, the EADI-supervised Republic of Ansam now—and stumbled on a column of armed strangers. After health checks and other procedures he’d been issued rations and a shovel—and, bewildered, had worked beside them ever since. They had been the happiest years of his life: no planter’s whip, no high-caste sneers, full meals every day—sometimes to bursting. He’d ached to bring his family, but the zone’s rules were one-way: in, not out. The chance never came.\n\nHis head thumped a grain sack as the truck braked. Another village in need. “Everyone off. Check for survivors. You especially, Soma—you said your family lived out here!”\n\nFamily… family! Soma’s head snapped up. That hill. That villa. Here—this was it! He tumbled from the truck, hit the dirt, and ran hard for the shack. “Please… please…” he prayed as he ran, yanking aside the grass curtain.\n\nHis mother was gently cooling Meena’s brow with a towel; his father, mud-stained bread in his fist, stared at him in wonder. Soma fell to his knees, words lost in his mouth, while the captain and crew pounded up with supplies.\n\nMoonlight sank behind the crags, and to the east the noise of morning…"

  PRC_rc2.31.t: "Looking Back"
  PRC_rc2.31.d: "So long—this cycle of seasons—measured in a century’s turn.\n\nA chill still on the air—long time no see, tidings of spring.\n\nMist rose and blurred the gaze; in a flicker, a thousand lights and shadows: the cauldrons at Humen, poison burned to ash; Zhiyuan’s dying cry, heroic souls unreturned; three shots of Yellow Blossoms, rotten trunks collapsing. We thought those three shots heralded spring—who knew that autumn would be brief and winter long, and after one hard snow, a hundred years of cold.\n\nClimb again the high terrace and cast the first look at the realm: piles of martyrs’ bones; brigands enthroned in the halls; loyal levies wheeling north—only for traitors to usurp the seat. The road we came by was dim even when the Master lived; after he left, blood smeared it end to end. See: factions feuding, the state in decline; Xiang waters dyed with loyal blood; iron spines could not save the city of Shanghai; stacked bones, Nanjing laid waste. Fourteen years of strife within, fourteen years of war without—who could avoid the scatter of stars, what house could escape the bitter wind and rain?\n\nRage unspent, riddles unresolved. Blade laid down and vexation unchanged, I beat the rail and look to the Milky Way. I recall the Qin’s iron and the Han’s marrow, the Tang’s soul and the Ming’s spirit; and I can’t help thinking of Jingkang’s shame, of the chapter at Lingding. The stars are bright, the road ahead unclear. I knock at heaven—no shelter; bow to earth—no aid. Wan’nan’s fire dies; the northern beacons flare; ghosts crowd the eastern sea; the northwest sinks low. Hard the road, hard the road—many forks; where now? When will the long wind come to heave the waves; how shall we hoist our sails to cross the blue?\n\nTurn again and look homeward—sudden shock: sun and moon replaced; mountains and rivers changed. Sparks in the north rolled up and kindled the plain. The fire warmed; the wind stayed cold; winter not yet gone; chill still keen. Flesh and bone sundered across the strait; the peninsula smoked time and again. We climbed to the eagle’s nest, we ranged by the tiger’s lair, and told ourselves, “Too much grievance breaks the bowels.” Within we stilled the quarrel; without we held the line. Decades of stumbling steps—then, in a blink, the sky went dark, the earth reeled. The north in pieces; the world upended. Foes fewer; partners gone.\n\nLate-winter winds bit deeper; the going grew hard. Yet the firmer the step, the stouter the will—and spring felt near.\n\nI often remember tears of old; tonight I dream of cups raised far apart.\n\nThe heroes bowed their heads for the people; the people wailed for the heroes.\n\nLet us meet, let us meet—and behold a ninefold land renewed."

Bitter or sweet—it was all only what the eyes could see and ears could hear; the taste within was hard to tell. But today the sky has changed; it is time to take up oar and pole, to part the mist and probe the heights.\n\nA light skiff comes from afar, bathed in morning’s universal glow; a chill clings yet. On both banks spring riots in the boughs: dark pines, green cypresses; bright water, red bridges; orioles and swallows singing, butterflies and bees at play. An old man fishes; a Chu wanderer hums; children laugh.\n\nClouds forge their height by roaming the sky; waves win their might by coursing the river. To cross the passes and seek Heaven’s Way—what fear of furious surge or startling breaker? I recall the past: windswept, rain-borne, the land desolate. I lift my eyes to the present: hoofbeats quick, armor bright—before a lone crane can pierce the clouds, the poem has already climbed the azure. Cups of warm wine pass from hand to hand; aboard the boat, words of joy abound: lines of iron horse and icy river; chapters of gallant ardor; judgments of clear rivers and quiet seas; discourses on the commonweal; sighs for universal love and just defense; praises of teaching without class… All these and more, a human roar winding and returning. Some drunk at the sight of ten-thousand dwellings; some in tears at last seeing the end of chaos; some who clutch a hidden sorrow are urged to drink; some dream back to the day when the hundred li were shared; some, seeing the revolution fulfilled, at last smooth their brows…\n\nLook from the boat: stars shift, things change. A hundred generations’ sunderings and unions always seek the greater right; a thousand-years’ parade of the eminent all return to dust.\n\nLeave a name or not—why sigh? You spent your life to the utmost; we, even with a century’s regrets, have none for our country’s peril. As mountains grow by not refusing the tiniest grains, and the sea by not refusing the swollen rivers, there is no “higher” or “lower” among us. With one heart and joint effort, even a heaven tilted thrice can be righted; with a city of will, even a land shattered a hundred times can stand. Where the people return, where the heart inclines—we can unite the realm in one war; settle the waves in two campaigns; make high gorges into level lakes; cut roads through sky-like chasms; return the rivers and hills to the people; forge a peace for all under heaven. And still the road feels unfinished: isles yet to be rebuilt, southern lands yet to be calmed. The east is whitening; the long night is not yet gone. Our ardor remains; our hands are not tired. Only follow the tide of the age; fear no grinding trial; walk with firm resolve—and the sky will open, the earth grow wide. As the verse says:\n\nSay not the road is far and hard; let drops together pierce the stone.\n\nTen thousand torrents to the sea; the trend of all things makes the world vast."

The dead twigs and withered leaves of reaction have been swept away by socialism’s bracing wind. The old East Asian order—built by the once-arrogant United States and inherited by the Pacific Pact—has been tossed onto history’s trash heap, and this ancient land of Asia greets a new hope. Long before the war began, China had already drafted plans large and small for the postwar rebuild. Now it is time to carry them out.\n\nIn Japan, those at the very bottom—long ignored—are stepping forward to build, not only in exchange for supplies but for a future they can actually see. All totems of militarism that should be torn down will be torn down; the reckoning that arrived eighty-four years late will at last be held. Freighters shuttle through Japanese ports with necessities of life, while drones make precise deliveries to the immobile, striving to secure every civilian’s day-to-day.\n\nIn India, order has returned across zones under PLA military administration. The secularization and de-radicalization of Hinduism advances step by step: religion is separated from politics and stripped of harmful dross, returning to a pure solace of the soul. Textbooks are rewritten; caste is dismantled by degrees; illiteracy fades. For the first time, Dalits taste what it means to be human.\n\nAcross Oceania, white supremacy ebbs. Those who used to strut about denouncing China now fall silent, no longer daring to air their ‘righteous’ tirades. New Zealand and Australia will merge as a federal commonwealth, and their peoples will share in a better life—striding forward with others toward a new future.\n\nAs for Papua New Guinea, a child dragged along by the tide: it will continue to shine within the new order as a Belt and Road signatory. Its resources will be developed effectively to feed its own economy, lighting a million lamps in the jungle nation.\n\nNepal’s tourism booms; absolute poverty vanishes in Bhutan; the black syndicates of Bangladesh and Myanmar are scoured away; manufacturing in Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia flourishes; disposable incomes in Malaysia and Singapore leap forward. Indonesia’s livelihood projects advance steadily; drug lords and bandits in the Philippines lie in their own blood; the two brothers on the Korean Peninsula embrace at last. And Vietnam—whose feelings toward China were the most tangled—finally lets go of old grudges and throws itself into building a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nRed flags billow—warm through three winters; blood-red suns aloft—chill even midsummer."

The boy was paying for everything, too.\n\nBone-conduction earbuds were live-translating Japanese to Chinese, and with that help he found the rendezvous spot.\n\nThe young engineer had been waiting. Overseas trial by fire had smoothed the youth’s impatience into steadier leadership. He was darker now, leaner too, but sharper all around.\n\nThe old man pushed over the suitcase with practiced ease. While the young one stowed it in the SUV and drew breath to explain the itinerary, the elder rapped his earbuds, killed the interpreter, and peered over reading glasses at a notebook of prewritten plans.\n\n“Your grandma and I are visiting Tōshōdai-ji tomorrow. No need for you to come—work first. This gizmo translates better than you anyway, and locals tell it best. Keep your three-legged ‘architecture’ to yourself.”\n\nThe young engineer wanted to cry.

  PRC_rc2.1003.t: "Beiyang Fleet Relics Return Home"
  PRC_rc2.1003.d: "A soft rain fell over Tokyo Bay in postwar Japan.\n\nAs the fires that had scorched all East Asia at last dimmed, a PLAN carrier strike group entered the very waters that had been an enemy’s core a hundred and twenty years ago—not to strike, but to receive a trove of artifacts that had lingered overseas for two full cycles of sixty years.\n\n“—One anchor from the Qing cruiser Zhenyuan; one main-gun shell from the Qing gunboat Pingyuan; one ship’s bell from Zhenyuan; two armor plates from Dingyuan…”\n\nLt. Lin Daiyu checked the transfer list as crates passed by, each stenciled with names every middle-schooler knew. The Japanese handler kept his face composed, but his knuckles on the pen had gone white.\n\nLin glanced at him, then bent again to her work. When four Dingyuan main shells went by, she halted the forklift, pried open a crate, and inspected the contents: a rust-scarred round, swaddled in cotton paper and wadding against the slightest harm.\n\n“Welcome home, Great-Grandfather. I’ve come to take you back.”\n\nFar away, the ancestral altar in her home held a single tablet: “For our forebear Lin Tai-zeng, Left-Wing Admiral of the Beiyang Fleet (with the rank of Commander): Spirit Tablet.”\n\nThe lid thumped shut. Out on the gray water, twin carrier groups loomed and vanished in the mist; their horns blew, and the sound rolled between sea and sky."
  PRC_rc2.1003.a: "A long wind over ten-thousand li at last crosses the Jade Gate; a thousand years on, the steel is stern as ever."

  PRC_rc2.1004.t: "Demolition Operation"
  PRC_rc2.1004.d: "“Last string!”\n\nLin Xiao wiped his brow and nested the charges at the base. Amphibious armor from Marine Landing Group One growled on the plaza; Z-21 gunships scythed the Kyūshū dawn. The Hakkō Ichiu Tower—a totem raised with 238 stones plundered from China—shuddered in its death throes. Beads of water slipped down the blurred characters for ‘Yamato Spirit’ and caught the wet shine in the eyes of the 17 engineers on the line.\n\n“‘Peace Tower,’ huh? What a joke.”\n\nAfter the “Jimmu’s Eastward Conquest” mural was hammered off, this tower—built with the Palace’s bricks, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum’s tiles, Taishan’s stone… three hundred sixty-five trophies of empire—would be ground to rubble, like the militarists of the Pact.\n\n“Back home we had an iron tower too. The Japs hauled off a big slab for this thing.” Zou Pingyang chewed his self-heating rice, sitting on an unusually flat stone in the center of the square. The sledge that had stunned the mural leaned at his side.\n\n“Three-minute countdown,” the platoon leader crackled over the net, a smile in his voice. Lin reeled in the last leads. His boots crunched soggy copies of the Imperial Rescript on Education scavenged from an archive. The old paper had drunk the rain; the ink bled like writhing worms. On the eastern rim seven tongues of fire leapt up—the vanguard’s opening salvo in a Shintō precinct now repurposed as an SDF depot. Flames danced mad in the fog.\n\n“Fire!”\n\nThe blast wave rattled stones against passing armor. Morning tore the smoke. On the ruin of Hakkō Ichiu, charred cherry petals fell. Sixteen J-16s from Air Brigade 338 screamed low overhead; three Type-271 amphibious IFVs rolled from cover and joined the flood surging north across Kyūshū."

  PRC_rc2.1005.d: "Xinhua, Shuri Castle—\n\nIn the small hours today, the Ryukyu Islands reached a turning-point in history: under strict supervision by international observers, the Ryukyu sovereignty referendum concluded. The news was a stone cast into a still lake, sending ripples across East Asia and the world.\n\nLegal scholars called it a “century-late answer to the Potsdam Declaration.” Eligibility was limited to residents of the Ryukyu Islands registered in Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare database as of 1 January 2029. In the presence of independent monitors from EADI members such as the DPRK and Pakistan and third countries such as Brazil, EADI’s Supreme Command announced the tally: 67.32% in favor of joining the People’s Republic of China; 21.45% in favor of independence; 11.03% in favor of joining the People’s Republic of Japan; 0.2% invalid.\n\nThe Ryukyus are not Japan’s lawful territory. For centuries they existed as a Chinese vassal kingdom, tied to China by close political, economic, and cultural bonds. In 1879, as the Qing waned, Japan seized its chance, imposed “abolish the domain, establish the prefecture,” annexed the islands, and killed the Ryukyu Kingdom.\n\nIn the Asian Liberation War, Ryukyuan crowds welcomed EADI troops—an omen of today’s result. Analysts note that although a century of Japanese rule eroded Ryukyuan identity, the previous militarist regime’s cultural repression after the Taiwan campaign, coupled with China sanctions that plunged the islands into recession, rekindled that identity. Memories of invasion pushed people to seek shelter—and public opinion tilted toward China.\n\nBoth the PRC and the PRJ stated they respect the Ryukyuan people’s choice."

  PRC_rc2.1006.t: "Parting Grief"
  PRC_rc2.1006.d: "Dishes were set; five figures ringed the table, waiting for the one empty space to be filled.\n\nA soft thud, a rolling gurgle.\n\nA pot of boiling broth slid across linen on wood and came to rest.\n\n“Itadakimasu.”\n\nLittle Midō lunged at the food. Three years of husks and gruel made every day now feel like bliss: fish and shrimp, meat and tea; walls once off-limits torn down for a public square. Everything suited his appetite.\n\nMisaki watched her younger son’s cheeks grow rosier, and the furrow in her brow eased. When he smacked his lips, she set her chopsticks down and began peeling shrimp for the little glutton. Their play took a bit of the edge off Kaede’s nameless unease; she covered her mouth and laughed. The tiny sound rippled across an eerie hush—and she suddenly heard the source: why was no one else speaking? Her eyes flicked from face to face: Grandfather’s brow knotted hard; Grandmother’s eyes still rimmed with tears; Father staring down, shoveling rice in by rote.\n\nSilence. Suffocating silence. Kaede lowered her chopsticks; the food’s flavor fled.\n\nGrandfather sighed, lifted a bite into Grandmother’s bowl, and murmured the old comfort about the dead not returning. Then, with effort, he resumed eating. Kaede heard her grandmother’s muffled sob; Father’s water splashed a few drops. Only Midō was untouched, happily wolfing down his dinner.\n\nLater Kaede sat by her mother and finally asked. More silence. At last a long breath—and words: “The entire Koneto family… a UXO in the ancestral plot.”\n\nSilence again. A sorrowful silence. The war was over—wasn’t it? They had just reclaimed their ancestral land; the reconstruction crews had just arrived; everything had just begun to turn for the better… Why?\n\nThe stooped figure on the hill staring down at the U.S. base; the rough voice cursing colonizers; the child’s laughing face—they flashed through her mind. Yesterday they had celebrated together on the square. Today, Yang and Yin.\n\nThere were more grieving souls. But life still had to go on."
  PRC_rc2.1006.a: "Let grief come in full—but let it pass soon."

  PRC_rc2.1999.t: "Dawn Has Come"
  PRC_rc2.1999.d: "Thin morning mist; corners of a gatehouse wink with gold-glazed light. The age-old sun pours out its rays. Dapples of color gleam on faces in the square—crowds waiting, cheering, for a great moment.\n\nThrough the sea of people, a ribbon of black moved—measured, perfumed with flowers, wrapped in applause—toward its place. The old man straightened a little and let his gaze pass over the citizens at the window. Past and present overlapped: cave-house fleas that stung at night; rock-hard peasant bread; sweet tea steaming on a threshing floor; a hall of identical ballots; a young face on a stretcher; a hoarse command beyond a ruin…\n\nA thunderclap; flames climbed high. A collapse no one expected shook the world—and from the shock a miracle was born: billions rallied to one ideal. Trial and travail reforged the sinew of the Republic and her sisters. The toxins of the Pact were purged. East Asia had set its feet on the bright, level road of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\n“Chairman, we’ve arrived.”\n\nThe gentle voice lifted him from reflection. He left the car and paced forward; the crowd flowed with him. A glance took it in: Vietnam’s chairman with more silver at the temples; Korea’s general, a little thinner; Pakistan’s prime minister—at last a surname from outside the old clans. The sun shone; not a century had passed and the ancient tower again welcomed a smiling host of new faces. They parted to give him way to the podium.\n\nHe heard it: a people’s joy like mountains, like seas. He saw it: red flags like storm-flung waves. He knew it: a new beginning had come as softly as a breath.\n\nA thousand urgent eyes upon him, the old man lifted the pages he knew by heart. The world seemed to hold its second. The square hushed. Camera motors clicked like a metronome.\n\nFrom the Amur to Tasmania, from Balochistan to Hokkaidō—the people wished to hear, longed to hear, yearned to hear…"

  PRC_rc2.2000.t: "Formation of the “Innovative Nations Union”"
  PRC_rc2.2000.d: "Since the end of the Great Asian War, the members of the East Asia Defense Accord have worked as one—steadfastly advancing reconstruction under the principle of mutual benefit. With the first phase now largely complete, regional output has recovered to 97% of prewar levels, and public-works systems have been rebuilt. Former Pact states are now deeply integrated with EADI, giving the lie—by fact, not promise—to the naysayers of an “Asian collapse,” and laying a solid foundation for full revival.\n\nThis milestone in Asia’s postwar rebuild is also a hinge in global geopolitics: in Beijing today, President Xi Jinping formally issued the Declaration of the “革新国家联合体,” announcing the new organization’s birth. The Declaration pledges: “The ‘Innovative Nations Union’ will take the well-being of all humankind as its root, a better future for humanity as its compass, and comprehensive, cross-domain cooperation as its base—striving to create a thriving, happy future for all; and it will resolutely strike at any force that would destroy it.” Leaders from many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America co-signed and offered congratulations to Co-Chair Xi afterward.\n\nThe U.S. State Department expressed regret; Russia declined comment. Analysts note that the ‘Innovative Nations Union’ unites roughly half the world’s population and more than 65% of its manufacturing capacity—an impact on world affairs rivaling even America’s second civil war.\n\nWhatever chancelleries may say, one fact is plain to see: China—ancient and ever-young—is stepping out to reshape the world’s order."

  PRC_rc2.2001.d: "The red star of the ‘Innovative Nations Union’ has risen; beneath its flag the people have bound their wounds and set sail toward a new world.\n\nFrom Saipan in the far east to Karachi in the west, from Wellington south to Mohe north, the newborn union holds over half of humanity and the lion’s share of industrial might. The pall of war has lifted; cities and villages rouse to life.\n\nThe world-island is still a pyre of stacked kindling; the wind still shifts, the clouds still boil. Eastward—North America, reunited, claws again at primacy. Northward—the great bear still dreams of Peter the Great. Where will the ‘Innovative Nations Union’ steer? Only those at the helm can guess the riddle’s end. But for now, people are content:\n\nIn Japan’s ruins, a worker lays a red brick atop a finished tower; inside a new shop, the machines thunder.\n\nUnder South Asia’s tarps, a hawker pushes a brand-new cart through the lanes; the five-star red glints fresh on its side.\n\nAt an Australian pit edge, miners mind the pumps as slurry runs; on the road below, trucks beat a steady pulse.\n\nIn Mongolian grass, herders drive sheep into the newborn sun; behind them, grass thrives beneath ranks of solar panels.\n\nYet even with a million hearts as one, there are places the sun cannot directly reach: remnants that refuse to die, exiles who cannot let go, and the hard problems within of politics and economy. To govern a great state is like cooking a small fish: after bold strokes, patience and a steady hand must do the rest.\n\nOne brush writes iron and mercy both across the map; one generation has walked its Long March, and handed in its paper. How will the ‘Innovative Nations Union’ inherit their will—cutting through waves, pressing ever on? The stories to come are yours to write.\n\nBorders are the body stretched across ages; rivers and peaks keep their pledge. The future of the ‘Innovative Nations Union’ is in your hands. Lead them onward. Gales over deep water cannot capsize Noah’s Ark; roaring rivers cannot resist Yu’s plow. Under the five-star red, leave no grain of suffering unseen; spare no tower of oppression unbroken. Only by hewing through bramble can we clear a path to tomorrow.\n\nRemember: seek truth from facts."

  PRC_south_asia_summit: "South Asia Summit"
  PRC_south_asia_summit_desc: "Though our mediation has brought a fragile and temporary calm to South Asia, this peace is unstable and brittle. Without active conciliation and de-escalation, the subcontinent will again fall into war."
  PRC_secure_trade_route: "Establish Sea–Land Trade Corridors"
  PRC_secure_trade_route_desc: "South Asia is a snarl of chaos: market order shattered, goods in absolute shortage, an economy on the brink, trade chains broken. They urgently need outside support to douse the immediate fire. We have deep experience and a robust, well-ordered trade system. We have both the duty and the ability to extend a hand—restoring healthy trade arteries for South Asia’s orderly development."
  south_asia_trade_route: "We have established sea–land trade corridors."
  PRC_social_reform: "Propose Social Reform Measures"
  PRC_social_reform_desc: "South Asia—one of humanity’s ancient cradles—once shone with brilliance. Yet constrained by geography and history, development lagged; above all, caste—an unseen but heavy shackle—has long stifled fairness and progress and denied the lower strata equal opportunity. We will conduct in-depth study and table targeted proposals urging change—breaking caste’s bonds."
  south_asia_social_reform: "We have proposed social reform measures."
  PRC_draft_south_asia_union_agreement: "Negotiate the South Asia Union Agreement"
  PRC_draft_south_asia_union_agreement_desc: "Internal frictions and frequent clashes wrack the region—an outcome we do not wish to see. India’s vast religious and ethnic contradictions exceed expectations. A stable, harmonious, and orderly South Asia better serves our interests. We will leverage our influence to convene thorough talks, organize multiple rounds of negotiations, and invite international experts—helping South Asia toward peace and development."
  south_asia_union_agreement: "We have drafted the South Asia Union agreement."
  PRC_south_asia_supplies: "Negotiate Material Aid"
  PRC_south_asia_supplies_desc: "The Asian War struck like a merciless storm, shattering ordinary Indian lives. India acted as an oppressor in the conflict; in one sense, its plight has a karmic hue—but the bill was handed to common people: hunger, disease, loss of home. On humanitarian grounds we will immediately open talks with all parties on aid—surveying real needs and shaping a detailed plan to bring hope and relief."
  south_asia_supplies: "We have concluded negotiations on material aid."
  PRC_start_meeting: "Declare the Summit Open"
  PRC_start_meeting_desc: "Here gather Indians from many walks of life—different classes, creeds, ideas, and colors—for the §YSouth Asia Summit§!. Some from great cities, some from distant villages; merchants and scholars alike. Can they bridge their divides and work for regional peace? Only time will answer. May this summit be a good beginning and a new chance for South Asia’s future."
  south_asia_meeting: "We have declared the summit open."
  PRC_kunming_declaration: "Kunming Declaration"
  PRC_kunming_declaration_desc: "The §YSouth Asia Summit§! has succeeded—an important step toward our goal. But challenges abound, and time is short. We will immediately form a drafting group to clarify duties and rights with precision—grounded in close study of South Asia’s history, culture, politics, and economy, and informed by global best practice—to lay a firm legal foundation for peace and stability."
  kunming_declaration: "We have proclaimed the Kunming Declaration."
  PRC_eadi_support: "Sign the EADI Aid Accord"
  PRC_eadi_support_desc: "After multiple rounds of discussion, we have consensus on every detail—from categories, quantities, and quality standards to transport, delivery time, and handover points. We will swiftly sign the accord and mobilize logistics to rush food, medicine, tents, and other aid to those most in need—helping South Asia out of crisis and back to normal life."
  summit_success: "The §YSouth Asia Summit§! concludes successfully!"
  summit_fail: "§YSouth Asia Summit§! Fails"
  summit_fail_desc: "Though our mediation brought a brief peace, it is unstable and brittle. Without continued conciliation, the subcontinent will again be plunged into war."
