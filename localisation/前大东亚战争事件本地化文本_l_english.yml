  PRC_rc1.1.t: "Report on the Plan to Completely Eliminate India’s Nuclear Capability"
  PRC_rc1.1.d: "\n\n\n                  £GFX_CMC_event_texticon   \n\n\n\n\nRespected Chairman:\n\nIn light of recent movements observed among senior PDO leaders, the Strategic Rocket Force, Air Force, Navy, and Information Support Force—working jointly with the Ministry of State Security—have drafted a plan to annihilate India’s nuclear capability.\n\nOn land and in the air, strategic bomber formations assembled over Tibet, Jammu & Kashmir, and the Shan airspace will, in concert with the Naval Aviation Force, execute penetrating precision strikes within the first 30 minutes of hostilities against all Indian nuclear launch complexes, ballistic-missile depots, heavy-water and fuel reprocessing plants, and uranium-enrichment facilities. The Rocket Force will launch hypersonic weapons and conventional MRBMs in synchrony to ensure destruction of those sites and achieve the strategic objective of eliminating India’s nuclear force.\n\nRegarding the Indian Navy’s Arihant-class SSBNs: due to the cutoff of certain U.S.-origin components, only one hull is currently capable of putting to sea. MSS Second Bureau, through multi-source corroboration, confirms it is presently berthed at Mumbai Naval Dockyard—now designated a priority target by the Rocket Force and Air Force. Our Naval UUV units, operating from Karachi, maintain 24/7 surveillance over the approaches; PLAN attack submarines are on station. Should missile and air strikes fail to sink the boat, a UUV swarm will cooperate with the SSNs to destroy it. Simultaneously, our SSNs will launch SLCMs against nuclear-related facilities in southern India.\n\nAll actions above will coincide with the Southwest Theater Air Force’s comprehensive strikes on IADS nodes, forward airfields, and critical industry.\n\nThe Information Support Force and Air Force EW aircraft, together with MSS cyber elements, will ensure the enemy’s communications are denied throughout the operation. Strategic missile-defense units are at full alert; even in the extreme case of a leaker launch, our midcourse BMD can intercept.\n\nAll participating units have filed battle pledges. We will not permit enemy nuclear warheads to fall upon the soil of our motherland.\n\nRespectfully,"

  PRC_rc1.2.t: "Finale of Vengeance"
  PRC_rc1.2.d: "\"Captain, orders from above—immediate sortie to combat patrol.\" The communicator’s voice carried a tight edge across the control room.\n\nCaptain Rajesh Singh lifted his head, calm-faced. Raised on the legends of Subhas Chandra Bose and hardened by India’s defeat to Pakistan years earlier, hatred of China had long been etched into his bones. If a chance came, he would see India’s enemies cast into ruin.\n\nAs India’s sole seaborne nuclear arm, INS Arihant eased from Mumbai Naval Dockyard with warheads aboard and high hopes upon her sail. Rajesh knew he was the top target for the Chinese Indian Ocean Fleet—above even India’s carriers.\n\n“Finally, the moment.” he murmured, as the boat slipped to maximum depth.\n\nA few hours later—“Captain, signal from Command!” The comms officer burst in. Rajesh tore the paper free. The word “VISHNU” seemed to glow black on white. He clenched his fist. If China would block India’s rise, then let them taste Brahma’s wrath.\n\n“Orders! Blow ballast—bow down fifteen, stern up fifteen, depth five-zero! Prepare to launch SLBMs!” The crew hesitated, then moved—tension thickening the air. Sweat rolled as seconds crawled.\n\n“Tube-filling noise—torpedo inject! Bearings 234, 016, 092—three sources, range/depth unknown!” the sonar man cried.\n\nCountermeasures and evasive maneuvers flickered across Rajesh’s mind—then died. “Ignore them. Keep ascending. Launch immediately!” Outnumbered three to one, any counterattack was hopeless. The attackers’ signatures were unclear—very likely China’s latest Type 095 SSN or unmanned undersea vehicles—neither a match for his aging hull. Better to gamble on a final shot—perhaps take millions with him.\n\nFate denied him. A Yu-11 thermal torpedo from a Type 095 slammed starboard at nearly 60 knots. Seawater roared through the 533 mm wound; under impossible stress the hull parted in two and dropped into blackness. Rajesh pinwheeled into a bulkhead, blood blurring his vision. He opened his mouth to curse Chinese, Pakistanis, all enemies—but only a thin hiss slipped from his blood-filled throat. No last words. Only dark.\n\nIn a coordinated kill by PLAN SSNs and UUV swarms, India’s final nuclear hope shattered and sank to the abyss…"

  PRC_rc1.3.t: "Shiva’s Eyes Close"
  PRC_rc1.3.d: "\"This is Rajnath Singh. Reports of an Eastern Coalition offensive are confirmed! Execute the launch order! Repeat—execute the launch order!\" Alarms howled across the control room at the Chandipur missile complex in Odisha. Personnel sprinted to consoles. Outside, a massive transporter lined up an Agni-V ICBM and began erection. India’s hopes rode that steel spine: if it flew, the enemy would meet Vishnu’s annihilating fury. The site commander stood, hands on hips, willing the gantry upward.\n\n“How long to full erection?”\n\n“Five minutes—”\n\nThe sirens cut him off—air-raid klaxons shrieked as the radar display filled with fast-approaching tracks.\n\n“Inbound strike detected!”\n\nBefore the word finished, the not-yet-upright Agni-V vanished in a blossom of fire as air-launched standoff munitions screamed in. A thunderclap tore the gantry apart; fragments and fireballs rained down. Simultaneously, every surface and underground node across the range was hammered by standoff weapons and bunker-busters.\n\nAs Chandipur burned, hypersonic glide vehicles and MRBMs traced contrails across the sky. Within hours, India’s missile fields, storage depots, and remaining nuclear facilities were devastated by surgical strikes from the Eastern Coalition Air Force and the Rocket Force. A handful of concealed pads survived the opening blows, but their stragglers could not punch through PLA missile defense. In practical terms, India’s nuclear strike capability was gone."

  guam.1.t: "U.S. Navy Adjusts Guam Fleet Deployment Amid Civil War Strain"
  guam.1.d: "Xinhua, Guam Bureau —\n\nThe U.S. Navy has announced major adjustments to its Guam-based fleet to cope with resource and manpower pressures stemming from domestic turmoil. Under the plan, technicians and veteran sailors will be pulled from the Guam formation to prioritize other carrier strike groups. The rump force, composed of three Kitty Hawk–class carrier strike groups and associated vessels, will be commanded by Admiral Harry Harris, former PACOM commander. Observers widely see the move as a strategic retrenchment under constrained resources.\n\nAnalysts note the American civil war has tightened resources and weakened Washington’s global posture; the Guam reorganization is proof. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said China remains committed to peace and development in the Asia–Pacific and stands ready to work with all parties to promote regional stability. As the complexity of the U.S. domestic situation deepens, China will continue to uphold the principles of peaceful coexistence and contribute to global stability."

  guam.2.t: "Guam-Based U.S. Navy Folded into JMSDF Amid Public Protests"
  guam.2.d: "Xinhua, Guam Bureau —\n\nJapan’s cabinet has agreed to Admiral Harry Harris’s proposal to form a special PDO fleet by integrating the U.S. holdover force from Guam.\n\nOn the day the U.S. Navy moved in, over 200 Japanese citizens gathered outside nearby bases to protest Tokyo’s decision. As carriers entered port, civic groups piloted two small boats past the flattops with banners reading “No to War” and “Never Again.”\n\nAt a reception later that day, Japan’s prime minister said both the U.S. Navy and Japan face growing defense burdens and would work with allies across the Pacific to share the load. Outside the venue, hundreds of protesters held signs reading “Never Let Japan Become a Battlefield Again!” and “U.S. Navy, Go Home.” Some said military outlays have risen since the Taiwan conflict—hardly grounds for “celebration.”\n\nAll U.S. naval forces that remained on Guam—three Kitty Hawk–class carrier strike groups and supporting surface combatants—will operate as a PDO special fleet in concert with the JMSDF.\n\nAdmiral Harris declared that relocating to Yokosuka aims to preserve Pacific peace and stability, adding he would himself “join” the JMSDF as a naval flag officer. He claimed the reorganization will safeguard sailors’ livelihoods while jointly “containing the expansion of ‘non-democratic forces’” in the region.\n\nIncoming U.S. forces will continue to enjoy extraterritoriality in Japan. Accidents near bases, aircraft noise, and crimes involving service members will thus remain a long-term burden for local residents."
  guam.2.a: "High-sounding words"

  guam.3.t: "MFA Spokesperson on the Guam Holdover Fleet"
  guam.3.d: "The U.S. Guam holdover fleet has formally merged into the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and Admiral Harry Harris proclaimed it a move “to preserve Pacific peace and stability.” China strongly condemns and firmly opposes this action.\n\nHarris’s behavior gravely violates international law and basic norms of international relations, and constitutes a blatant provocation to Asia–Pacific peace and stability. Treating the Guam holdover fleet as part of the JMSDF fuels regional tensions and emboldens the so-called Pacific Defense Organization in undermining peace. China is seriously concerned and resolutely opposes any act that endangers regional security.\n\nTo safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and uphold regional stability, China will treat the relevant vessels of the Guam holdover fleet as PDO naval assets and target them accordingly. This is necessary and justified, and reflects China’s firm resolve not to be cowed by any external threat or challenge. China has the confidence and capability to defend its legitimate rights and interests; no provocation will shake our will.\n\nChina remains committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and stands ready to work with the international community to maintain Asia–Pacific peace and stability. We urge the PDO to cease its destructive conduct, face reality, and return to the right path. We call on all nations to oppose hegemony and power politics and jointly promote world peace and development.\n\nThe Chinese people’s resolve to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity is unshakable. China will take concrete actions to safeguard its rights and contribute tirelessly to regional peace."

  guam.4.t: "The Last Task Force"
  guam.4.d: "The Kitty Hawk’s damage-control chief petty officer stood stunned on the torn deck. He shouldn’t have been in this war at all, yet an old ghost gnawed at him—the memory of his grandfather, a falcon of the old Imperial Japanese Navy, a petty officer who flew from the carrier Kaga and was shot down over Shanghai. As a descendant of the Shōwa navy, he felt bound to avenge his honored ancestor—to right accounts with the Chinese.\n\nBut he and his fleet had not even managed to wound the People’s Navy in a straight fight. The PDO task force lay in ruins; Kitty Hawk’s buoyancy reserves were gone. Without Yorktown-era damage control—and the industry behind it—the flagship’s only fate was to feed coral on the Pacific floor.\n\nThe U.S. Navy was no longer what it once was. The petty officer would not board a lifeboat. In the final instant before the sea closed over him, he groped for a death poem in the old tradition.\n\nThere was no time. The carrier’s capsizing vortex took him into the depths."

  guam.5.d: "The last task force has returned to home port. The titanic battle of the Eastern Pacific is over; the PDO’s task force has had its back decisively broken. Yet the price was real: some bunks in the carrier barracks are temporarily—or forever—empty.\n\n“Got all of Old Zhou’s things boxed? His family’s coming this afternoon,” Pilot Lao Li asked, waving the last notebook at the door.\n\n“That’s the last of it. The man kept so little—can’t even fill a single crate.” Lao Li thumbed open the notebook. Since Zhou is likely still unconscious in the hospital, peeking at a wingman’s notebook is practically a required course for conjugate pairs; the owner won’t mind.\n\nInside was the upper stanza to the tune *Po Zhen Zi*—orderly, careful brushstrokes weighed word by word:\n\n“Through ages the vast sea heaves;\nTen-thousand-mile winds beat the waves.\nIn those years four hundred million shed one tear;\nTonight our long halberds hack at chains.”\n\nAnd the final line was…"

  guam.6.t: "The Great Lyricist"
  guam.6.d: "Zhou Haitang shouldered his kit and knocked on that familiar yet strange door. He had spent the last half-year in a hospital bed.\n\nThough the East Sea Fleet ultimately credited his antiship missile as the direct cause of Kitty Hawk’s sinking, being shot down by a SAM, bobbing in the ocean for three hours, and then spending six months immobile in a ward—he never wanted that again.\n\n“Well, our great lyricist is back. When are you finishing the second stanza of *Po Zhen Zi*? Everyone’s waiting.” Zhou rolled his eyes—no need to ask; that dog Lao Li had read his notebook.\n\nZhou waved a hand, notebook in his grip. Seeing every gaze in the room turn his way, he slowly opened it and read the lower stanza he’d polished for three months:\n\n“Rain of rounds pierces cloud and blots the sun;\nWar-smoke rolls over waves and swallows the rainbow.\nHaving ended the world’s fires of war,\nWe welcome peace beneath the vault of heaven.\nA red dawn sings triumph.”\n\nHis mates burst into cheers and showered the room with confetti they’d bought in advance."

  china.zangnan.t: "Liberation of Zangnan"
  china.zangnan.d: "Today the heroic People’s Liberation Army liberated the entirety of Zangnan, returning it fully to the embrace of the motherland. The ersatz “Arunachal Pradesh” has vanished like smoke.\n\nEighty years into New China, the feeble image of the late Qing and the Ganden Phodrang signing away the nation’s dignity has long since been swept away. The land has been reborn. Yet the jagged gaps along our shield of mountains—fragments of past humiliation—have continued to pain the national heart.\n\nFor this, many sons and daughters sacrificed much. Through harsh years of sparse infrastructure, generations of Tibetans put down roots without complaint to guard their homes—which is to say, the frontier of the motherland. Under long discipline and restraint, border troops patrolled day and night, countless times gazing across at our own soil with a sigh. From the 1904 Battle of Gyantse, to the 1962 self-defense counterattack, to the heroes of 2020—Qi Fabao, Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan, Wang Zhuoran—and to today’s Great Asian War, generation after generation have stood against all invaders with their lives. Blood stained the snow, and kept the plateau pure. Now, the Five-Starred Red Flag flies south of the Himalayas. Their sacrifices have a period at last, and it falls to the beneficiaries of their shade to remember their merit forever.\n\n“Born to soar, vast Kunlun; after surveying all the springs of man.” The eagle has only just spread its wings. The liberation of Zangnan is but the first step. The PLA will press on—until India is fully pacified, and then until all Asia’s peoples are free."
