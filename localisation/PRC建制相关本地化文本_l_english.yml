  PRC_national_production_dynamic_modifier: "Made-in-China Power"
  PRC_national_production_dynamic_modifier_desc: "§YOn a single day the great roc rides the wind, soaring ninety thousand li.§!\nMachine tools, gas turbines, engines, airliners, chips, lithography machines… one by one these former “industrial crown jewels” are being plucked by the industrious and ingenious Chinese people. China’s once-feeble industry now drives the world’s productive forces forward with unimaginable vitality.\nAs heaven moves strong, the gentleman strives unceasingly. The Chinese people will not stop. Riding the east wind of the fourth industrial revolution—centered on intelligence—China’s industry will complete its shift from follower to leader, reshaping the global productivity landscape as a pioneer and rule-maker."
  PRC_national_market_dynamic_modifier: "National Unified Mega-Market"
  PRC_national_market_dynamic_modifier_desc: "The aspiration for a unified national market can be traced back to the pre-Qin and Han eras. From the birth of a unified realm, central governments of successive dynasties strove to bind China’s vast lands into an economically integrated whole.\n\nTimes change, and today the Chinese people are closer to this dream than ever—almost within reach: rapid advances in modern transportation, fast-paced railway construction, the rollout of highways, the popularization of air transport, and busy canals that string together economic centers like great arteries… No one can yet know what majestic power a fully unimpeded Chinese economy will unleash."
  PRC_national_digital_dynamic_modifier: "China’s Digital Socialism"
  PRC_national_digital_dynamic_modifier_desc: "\nBehind the steady voyage of China’s great ship lies a miracle of countless grassroots officials meshing like precision gears. The sad truth is that people are not perfectly reliable: laziness, mistakes, negligence, corruption—chronic ailments that gnaw at the political system. Yet with technological progress they will fade into the past: nationwide e-government connectivity, handling affairs without leaving home, fully transparent oversight and auditing workflows—ever-advancing technologies are breathing new life into the bureaucracy."
  PRC_communist_party_of_china_dynamic: "Communist Party of China"
  PRC_communist_party_of_china_dynamic_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_improve_party_discipline_banner£\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Communist Party of China (CPC) was founded on July 23, 1921. From its birth it established the correct path of the New Democratic Revolution, giving a suffering people new hope and reliance. The Party blazed the correct path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power by armed struggle—“rousing millions of workers and peasants” to “wrest the whip and strike the enemy.” Through the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, it overthrew the “three great mountains” of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, founded the People’s Republic of China where the people are masters of the country, ended the long era of internal strife and foreign aggression, poverty and weakness, and opened a new epoch of national development and progress.\n\nThe CPC is the vanguard of China’s working class as well as the vanguard of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation; it is the core leadership of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It represents the requirements of the development of China’s advanced productive forces, the forward direction of China’s advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses. The Party’s highest ideal and ultimate goal is the realization of communism.\n\nThe CPC takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Important Thought of the “Three Represents,” the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as its guide to action. Party leadership is the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Party’s central task is to unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups nationwide to build a great modern socialist country in all respects, achieve the Second Centenary Goal, and, through Chinese-style modernization, advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
  PRC_made_in_china_dynamic: "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"
  PRC_made_in_china_dynamic_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_socialism_with_chinese_characteristics_banner£\n\n\n\n\n\nSocialism with Chinese characteristics is a development path pioneered by the CPC and the people by rooting in China’s conditions and integrating Marxism with Chinese civilization. With Party leadership as its most essential feature, it upholds the socialist market economy, whole-process people’s democracy, and common prosperity, forming the “five-sphere integrated plan” covering the economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. Through reform and opening-up it achieved an economic takeoff and historically eliminated absolute poverty; by science-and-technology innovation it drives high-quality development with many fields entering the world’s forefront; by practicing “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,” it accomplished epic environmental protection; by advocating the Belt and Road and a community with a shared future for mankind, it preserves an oasis of order in a chaotic age. In the new era, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has guided institutional improvement and governance modernization. Leveraging the advantage of “pooling resources to accomplish major undertakings,” China achieved feats such as crewed spaceflight and the anti-epidemic struggle, creating a new paradigm of modernization at massive population scale. This path refutes the “end of history” and demonstrates socialism’s vitality in the 21st century, offering developing countries practical inspiration for an independent path to modernization."
  PRC_20th_1st_meeting: "1st Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee"
  PRC_20th_1st_meeting_desc: "The unified aspiration of three generations has been realized—an extension of the Liberation War—and the end of the era since 1949 in which the KMT fled to Taiwan and long partitioned Chinese territory, sundering kin across the strait. The First Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee was the first major meeting convened after complete victory in the Liberation War. It determined, in a new era and new circumstances, upon whom, by what, and how China should develop after accomplishing national reunification."
  PRC_13th_5th_meeting: "CPPCC 13th National Committee, 5th Session"
  PRC_13th_5th_meeting_desc: "General Secretary Xi Jinping stated: “There is no single, supreme model of modernization, nor a standard that fits all.” \n\nTo greet the new era, our political development must not lag. We shall unite all forces that can be united—fully mobilize the democratic parties, representatives from all walks of life, and the broad masses to join us—and, by convening the 5th Session of the 13th CPPCC, jointly explore a path brimming with socialism with Chinese characteristics!\n\nWe will faithfully follow the CPPCC’s sixteen-character guideline, give full play to its roles in political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in and deliberation of state affairs; uphold the patriotic united front; unite all progressive forces at home; and forge the broadest patriotic consensus to develop a Chinese path beneficial to the people. This will serve as our political road to build the future, a new starting point for exploring the Chinese model, and will provide fresh Chinese wisdom for human development!"
  PRC_deepen_reform: "Stay on the Socialist Road"
  PRC_deepen_reform_desc: "History has proved the socialist road is boundlessly bright, and the Chinese people are marching upon it. We stand at the crest of scientific and technological innovation; we add vibrant colors to the scroll of rural revitalization; we shine upon the stage of international cooperation.\n\nTo uphold the socialist road is the call of the times and the people’s choice.\n\nWith unremitting struggle we shall press forward on this path and write a magnificent chapter of national rejuvenation."
  PRC_people_democratic_dictatorship: "Strengthen the People’s Democratic Dictatorship"
  PRC_people_democratic_dictatorship_desc: "“Flowing water does not rot, and a door hinge does not decay.” The people are the living source that propels social development. In the famed “cave dialogue” at Yan’an, Comrade Mao Zedong offered the first answer to escaping history’s cycle—let the people supervise the government. Genuine, effective democracy is the necessary way to break the cycle: “Only when the people supervise the government will the government not dare to slacken; only when everyone takes responsibility will policies endure beyond any one person.” The people’s democratic dictatorship is the key mechanism that keeps the source flowing forever. Strengthening it will lay a solid foundation for long-term stability."
  PRC_explore_new_socialist_system: "Explore the ‘Chinese Century’ System"
  PRC_explore_new_socialist_system_desc: "To meet great changes unseen in a century, our Party needs new institutions for new challenges. We will explore an institutional-innovation path guided by the Four Cardinal Principles and empowered by new technologies, greeting the arrival of the “Chinese Century” with a fresh posture."

  PRC_adjust_lower_cadre: "Select & Assign Grassroots Cadres"
  PRC_adjust_lower_cadre_desc: "The CPC and the government are no castles in the air, but solid bedrock rooted deep at the grassroots—like hardy saxaul trees thriving across vast lands. Going deep among the people, listening to their voices, relieving their worries is the Party and government’s abiding mission. Grassroots cadre selection is like precision sowing—sending outstanding talent to local posts across the land—so that the Party’s care and policies can irrigate with precision and inject inexhaustible momentum into grassroots development."
  PRC_built_national_market: "National Unified Mega-Market"
  PRC_built_national_market_desc: "In the past, two chronic ailments—local protectionism and vanity projects—blocked factor flows and market coordination: protectionism erected barriers and fragmented markets; vanity projects chased the big and flashy while neglecting SMEs. The planned national mega-market will break these pain points: strengthen top-level design, unify rules and standards, remove policy and institutional obstacles, promote unimpeded factor flows, and pursue balanced development among all market entities—building an efficient, fair, and open market to optimize resources and drive high-quality growth."
  PRC_deepen_capital_reform: "Deepen SASAC Reform"
  PRC_deepen_capital_reform_desc: "State-owned enterprises, pillars of the national economy, play a crucial role in stabilizing the macro picture and safeguarding people’s livelihood—especially amid today’s complex, volatile markets. Reform of SASAC is thus necessary. Through optimizing layouts and improving supervision, we can strengthen SOEs’ core competitiveness, raise resource-allocation efficiency, and advance the state economy toward high-quality development—better serving major national strategies."
  PRC_place_government_debt: "Resolve Local Government Debt"
  PRC_place_government_debt_desc: "Local debt is the foremost thorny issue for local governments—a classic “gray rhino.” Facing the severe challenge, the center plans on one hand to dispatch teams nationwide to survey debt conditions, craft precise reduction plans, rationally adjust fiscal expenditure structures, and raise fund-use efficiency; and on the other hand to broaden financing channels and actively guide social capital into infrastructure and other projects. These measures will both ease local debt pressures and bolster resilience—promoting steady, sustainable local development."
  PRC_country_consumption_subsidy: "National Consumption Subsidies"
  PRC_country_consumption_subsidy_desc: "Traditional Western neoliberal economics eschews state intervention—but the Chinese people do not trust such empty talk. By leveraging the industrial policies we excel at, we will explore a development path suited to our national conditions. The rollout of national consumption subsidies is a prime example: targeted subsidies can spur consumer enthusiasm, expand domestic demand, revitalize markets, keep industrial chains humming, and support sustained, healthy growth."
  PRC_all_implement_new_pub_priv: "Promote Public–Private Partnerships"
  PRC_all_implement_new_pub_priv_desc: "We must soberly recognize that the golden age of rapid private-sector expansion has passed. With a more complex international environment, mounting competitive pressure, and new challenges in resource allocation, the limitations of private firms in efficiency, innovation synergy, and productivity are increasingly evident. Advancing public–private partnerships is a forward-looking, strategic move—combining the stability, resources, and policy advantages of state capital with the flexibility and innovative vigor of private enterprises to invigorate market actors, optimize industrial structure, and drive steady, efficient, sustainable growth."
  PRC_central_implement_justice: "Conference on Governing the Country by Law"
  PRC_central_implement_justice_desc: "Comprehensively ruling the country in accordance with law is a profound transformation in national governance. We must unswervingly uphold the rule of law, and solidly advance sound legislation, strict law enforcement, impartial justice, and law observance by all. Building a law-based China requires strengthening ideological guidance and promoting holistic progress, improving the socialist rule-of-law system on the new journey. Law must be made and refined in step with the times. On advancing scientific legislation, the conference clarified the need to base work on political-legal functions, coordinate making, amending, repealing, and interpreting laws, strengthen legislative research, and raise legislative quality."
  PRC_monitoring_sword: "The Sword of Supervision"
  PRC_monitoring_sword_desc: "Supervisory authority was mainly transferred from the three oversight streams of Party discipline, administration, and procuratorates—endowing it with an inherently composite power. The 2018 supervisory reform further empowered the National Supervisory Commission, embodying both political and legal logic. It ensures discipline in political-legal work is strictly implemented across all levels and consolidates the anti-corruption gains since the 18th National Congress. Raising high the sword of supervision, further standardizing the “four forms” of discipline enforcement—investigate all that should be investigated, prosecute all that should be prosecuted—can ensure that the power entrusted by the Party and the people is not abused."
  PRC_law_china: "Toward a Law-Based Society"
  PRC_law_china_desc: "After a series of arduous systemic reforms took root, we can declare marked progress in comprehensively governing the country by law. Yet rule-of-law building is never finished. The eleven upholds and measures of the new-era judicial reform should remain long-term guiding spirit and routine deployment across political-legal organs—ensuring the people, according to the Constitution and laws, manage public affairs through various channels and forms, and realize socialist democracy’s institutionalization, legalization, and proceduralization. Circles do not lose their compass; squares do not lose their rule; roots do not forsake branches. Governing in the proper Way—then all things can be accomplished."
  PRC_government_digitalization: "Digital People’s Government"
  PRC_government_digitalization_desc: "With the development of 5G and new-generation information technologies such as big data and cloud computing, our government will use advanced tech to further optimize internal organization, procedures, and public services—forming a “Digital People’s Government” that “communicates with data, decides with data, serves with data, and innovates with data.”"
  PRC_enterprise_business_digitalization: "Enterprise Oversight Channel"
  PRC_enterprise_business_digitalization_desc: "We will integrate major enterprises’ financial data and tax records and, using advanced technologies, build a vast digital supervision platform: citizens can at any time and place monitor whether firms comply with law; other companies can quickly query credit records and operating status; the central government can readily supervise capital flows and taxation—effectively curbing corporate malfeasance."
  PRC_smart_government_system: "Smart Governance System"
  PRC_smart_government_system_desc: "Although we previously proposed “reducing the number of trips people must make” for government services, in the information age simply streamlining procedures no longer meets public needs. We now call for “letting data run more.” With advanced information technologies at its core, we will build a new governance system featuring holistic linkage, inter-departmental coordination, full-post coverage, and end-to-end management."
  PRC_promote_members_client: "Promote Citizen Portal"
  PRC_promote_members_client_desc: "Online government feedback windows have greatly facilitated public supervision of government work and improved service efficiency. The new generation of digital government must invest more in and promote this area—bringing the people’s voices directly into government, enabling “face-to-face” communication between people and state, and providing strong support for further improving governmental efficiency."

  ## This is the final battle of the anti-corruption campaign
  PRC_20th_3rd_meeting: "3rd Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee"
  PRC_20th_3rd_meeting_desc: "With national reunification finally achieved, the Center has decided to continue the work of economic construction in the new era: deepen comprehensive reform, drive high-quality development, and advance common prosperity. We will continue to uphold a people-centered development philosophy, develop new quality productive forces empowered by information technology, build the industry–academia–research system, further strengthen sustainability measures, launch a new wave of construction, and lead the fourth industrial revolution."

  PRC_dare_to_fights: "§RDare to Fight§!"
  PRC_dare_to_fights_desc: "In past Taiwan Strait crises the PLA proved its absolute dominance in the Asia-Pacific, while the United States is mired in civil strife and unable to extricate itself. It is time to lay aside the strategy of “keeping a low profile.” Against any foe daring to challenge the Republic’s core interests, we will no longer yield—the People’s Liberation Army will deliver the firmest counterblow!"
  PRC_super_project: "§ORepublic Super-Projects§!"
  PRC_super_project_desc: "To boost employment and the economy—while projecting national prestige and showcasing world-leading engineering prowess—the State Council has approved a slate of “super-projects” for the next decade.

  PRC_stabilize_market: "Stabilize the Real-Estate Market"
  PRC_stabilize_market_desc: "Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the real-estate bubble has been a major hidden risk, and sky-high prices in megacities have drawn public ire. It is time to resolve this issue. The State Council will roll out a comprehensive policy package to guide prices steadily downward over coming years while massively building affordable and public rental housing to meet just housing needs. An excess-property tax scheme has been submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for review. Substantial progress is on the horizon."
  PRC_sane_employment: "Strengthen Enforcement of the Labor Law"
  PRC_sane_employment_desc: "The Labor Law exists to safeguard workers’ lawful rights and interests. Yet amid industrialization and reform, gaps in enforcement have harmed those rights. The law must be carried through into every stage of work—ensuring laborers are duly rewarded and upholding the distribution system with distribution according to work as the mainstay alongside multiple forms."
  PRC_commonwealth: "Achieve Common Prosperity"
  PRC_commonwealth_desc: "Common prosperity means prosperity for all, and in all dimensions. The 20th Party Congress made two major assertions from the perspective of “essential requirements.” First: “Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism with Chinese characteristics.” Second: “The essential requirements of Chinese-style modernization are: upholding CPC leadership, upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, achieving high-quality development, developing whole-process people’s democracy, enriching people’s spiritual world, and realizing common prosperity for all.” Proposed as early as 1953, common prosperity saw detours amid socialist construction, with errors on both “left” and right.

We must further address local economic issues!"

  PRC_world_factory: "World Factory"
  PRC_world_factory_desc: "Since reform and opening-up, China has achieved major industrial growth by undertaking low-end industrial transfers from developed Western countries. In the 21st century, the Party vigorously cultivated indigenous innovation talent, seized the window created by U.S. anti-terror wars, and continuously upgraded industry—ultimately securing our position as the 'world factory'. Our industrial capacity is unmatched, and 'Made in China' has reached households across the globe. Going forward, China’s role as the world factory will power global development, while our people’s living standards will keep rising."

  PRC_tech_out_world: "Take Chinese Tech Global"
  PRC_tech_out_world_desc: "Xiaomi, Huawei, DJI, BYD, Chery… The sudden split and collapse of the United States removed many shackles from our firms.

In the new century, more exhibitors and richer projects have joined, with ever more international customers adding luster.\nThe Zhuhai Airshow is more than an exhibition; it mirrors the openness, humility, and confidence of countless Chinese enterprises, defense workers, and space professionals. Our companies engage in global exchanges and bid for international orders; their R&D and technical standards progress rapidly amid competition. Each airshow showcases China’s cutting-edge advances over the past two years—the 16th Zhuhai Airshow will be no exception."

  PRC_highway_expand: "Expand the High-Speed Rail Network"
  PRC_highway_expand_desc: "Even before COVID-19, China’s high-speed rail was a shining international calling card. HSR construction has unique significance for us: people across the country choose it for long-distance travel; intercity expresses in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and other metros are vital supplements to urban transport; and HSR is an indispensable pillar of Spring Festival travel. We should further expand the network, strengthen nationwide connectivity, and advance the building of a unified national market."

Humanity’s use of solar energy will take an unprecedented leap."

  PRC_nuclear_energy: "§GNuclear Energy Revolution§!"
  PRC_nuclear_energy_desc: "China’s nuclear-energy technology has long been 'far ahead.' Now, in response to the dual-carbon mobilization, CNNC engineers present their pride: the 'Hualong II' nuclear power unit design. As a fourth-generation nuclear technology with fully independent IP, it marks another big step in nuclear application.\nPuzzling to many engineers, however, is why such advanced, mature tech has only a handful of build approvals. Perhaps the state prefers a 'small steps, fast run' approach?\n\n§GCompared to the technology of the future, this reactor’s output is as small as a AAA battery.§!"

  PRC_increase_science_budget: "Increase the Science Budget"
  PRC_increase_science_budget_desc: "As early as 1988, Comrade Deng Xiaoping—chief architect of reform—concluded that 'science and technology are the primary productive force.' Over 70 years since founding, China’s sci-tech has made great strides, catching up with or surpassing Western powers in many fields. With political upheavals in Europe and America, we should seize the moment, sharply increase R&D budgets, build newer and larger facilities, and attract global scientists to join the scientific enterprise for all humankind."

  PRC_vocational_education: "Strengthen Vocational Education"
  PRC_vocational_education_desc: "During five decades of marketization, once-coveted vocational education declined rapidly and, amid multiple university expansions, faded into a byword for 'poor students.' To change this, the Center will coordinate factory–school alignment to raise the social and economic status of vocational graduates—training a vast cohort of highly skilled workers surpassing peers worldwide."

  PRC_powerful_science: "Rejuvenate the Nation through Science & Education"
  PRC_powerful_science_desc: "The trade war launched by Trump in 2016 once made us suffer, and we vowed never again to let the 'nose-ring' of critical core technologies be held by others! Today our sci-tech development has reached heights unimaginable a decade ago. We can proudly declare: China is a power in science and talent—no country can choke us again!"

  PRC_university_research: "Specialize Academia in Universities"
  PRC_university_research_desc: "Science and technology are the primary productive force. Our universities have no shortage of students with solid fundamentals; what we need are young innovators who can lead the next generation of Chinese research. Through administrative and curricular reforms, assessment changes, textbook selection reviews, and comprehensive education-innovation projects, we will refocus students on frontier research—further enhancing university research capacity."

  PRC_computing_power: "Compute Revolution"
  PRC_computing_power_desc: "To meet surging research compute demand from incoming international scientists, and to speed automation and industrial upgrading, the State Council has approved a special budget to build and grid-connect new national supercomputing centers in Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Hefei, and more. These centers will adopt new designs and technologies brought by international researchers, contributing to China’s rise as a science power. Meanwhile, the quantum computing pilot in Beijing has entered trial operation; if progress continues, we will lead a new compute revolution."

  PRC_fourth_technology_revolution: "Lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution"
  PRC_fourth_technology_revolution_desc: "China missed the first two industrial revolutions due to a decaying feudal order and Western oppression, and in the third information revolution we were only a participant lagging behind. In the 2020s, a revitalized socialist China will lead the globe into the Fourth Industrial Revolution—launched by the Chinese people and shared by the world!"

  PRC_space_plan: "Sail for the Star Sea"
  PRC_space_plan_desc: "After the U.S. civil war, China’s space sector became the world’s only 'superpower', absorbing top aerospace talent from across the globe. We will undertake ambitious programs—space elevators, stellar bases, and more dreams once out of reach—declaring to the world: the Chinese people’s dream is the boundless sea of stars!"

  PRC_nation_never_forget: "The Motherland Will Not Forget!"
  PRC_nation_never_forget_desc: "China’s space technology has advanced rapidly to world-leading levels. In the foreseeable future we will launch plans once deemed 'impractical' or even 'fantastical': lunar bases, Mars landings… These require the toil of a generation of researchers and the concerted effort of the whole nation. Our names may be unknown—but the motherland will not forget."

  PRC_again_bullet: "Sound the Bugle Again"
  PRC_again_bullet_desc: "The Second Gutian Conference enabled our army to demonstrate formidable combat power and will in the Taiwan Strait. Yet postwar we still face issues: insufficiently advanced equipment and limited fielding; some soldiers indulging in postwar ease and speculation. These sow hidden risks for the future. It is time to sound the bugle again—strengthen armaments and rouse our troops!"

  PRC_military_industry_modernization: "Modernize the Defense Industry"
  PRC_military_industry_modernization_desc: "Modern forces are built on modern weapons. Future R&D should proceed with research, testing, and deployment in parallel—an 'integrated approach' combining theory with practical needs. Focus now on equipment R&D and production reform, fully absorbing combat lessons, understanding the military’s real needs, and expanding industrial capacity to meet national defense demands."

  PRC_overall_security: "Holistic National Security Concept"
  PRC_overall_security_desc: "The Holistic National Security Concept safeguards strategic security, strengthens national security work, and ensures social development and people’s well-being. As the guiding ideology for security, it provides direction to all departments and society. With socialist construction advancing, it will serve as a shield of the nation—exerting practical force and ensuring security."

  PRC_china_military: "Defense Forces of the Republic"
  PRC_china_military_desc: "From the Nanchang Uprising onward, the People’s Army has stood with the Party and the people through storm and stress, writing heroic epics with absolute loyalty. With the final battle of national liberation concluded, the army once again proved its loyalty. In today’s volatile world, this loyal people’s army must grow into a mighty lion. We will therefore launch a new round of military reforms."

  PRC_start_from_gutian: "§GFrom Gutian, We Set Out Again§!"
  PRC_start_from_gutian_desc: "The Second Gutian Conference enabled our army to demonstrate formidable combat power and will in the Taiwan Strait. Yet postwar we still face issues: insufficiently advanced equipment and limited fielding; some soldiers indulging in postwar ease and speculation. These sow hidden risks for the future. It is time to sound the bugle again—strengthen armaments and rouse our troops!"

  PRC_wojiangwuwo_bufurenmin: "§RI Will Forget Myself for the People§!"
  PRC_wojiangwuwo_bufurenmin_desc: "Having further resolved domestic issues in science, the economy, and the military, China has half a foot across the threshold of basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035. This will be a historic milestone for the PRC and for the Chinese people’s realization of the Chinese Dream."

  PRC_new_journey: "A New Journey"
  PRC_new_journey_desc: "Once again, the CPC has led the Chinese people to achieve their grand goals. It is time to pack up and set out anew. China will uphold Party leadership and strive for every step forward—because we know that, in the near future, people may speak more interesting words, write more perfect prose, and undertake more magnificent causes. Yet today is only today—and the future is but today’s future."
  
  PRC_china_century: "§YThe Chinese Century§!"
  PRC_china_century_desc: "Under central coordination, political and economic order and people’s livelihoods in Taiwan have largely stabilized. With the fall of our old rival across the Pacific and comprehensive victories achieved by the Chinese people at home and abroad in recent years, China’s international standing has risen to unprecedented heights. A golden window is opening for our new-era development and for foreign economic, trade, and military cooperation. As a foremost great power on the world stage, we will formally declare to all—The Chinese Century has arrived!"

  PRC_twentieth_conference: "§OThird Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee§!"
  PRC_twentieth_conference_desc: "The leftover issues of the Liberation War have been resolved; the United States across the ocean is in chaos; shortcomings exposed during the Taiwan Strait conflict demand urgent fixes; remnants of imperialism in Japan and India remain restless; Southeast Asian countries weigh us against the Pacific Defense Treaty for advantage—at this critical juncture, our Party needs a meeting to summarize the situation, sort information, and set the next-phase line. The Central Committee will convene the Third Plenum of the 20th Central Committee ahead of schedule to discuss China’s future direction."

  PRC_insist_reform: "Uphold Reform and Opening-Up"
  PRC_insist_reform_desc: "Launched in 1978, reform and opening-up brought China unprecedented rapid development. Forty years of practice fully prove that reform and opening-up is a vital instrument enabling the Party and people to stride with the times, the only path to upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, the decisive move determining contemporary China’s destiny, and the decisive move to realize the Two Centenary Goals and national rejuvenation."

  PRC_cadre_rotation: "Restart Cadre Rotation"
  PRC_cadre_rotation_desc: "Middle-level Party and government cadres sit at the crucial link between higher and lower levels. Cross-department rotation among this group is a rigorous step in cadre personnel reform: it provides multi-post training platforms, promotes orderly mobility, breaks 'middle bottlenecks,' and cultivates versatile talent. Some locales have gained results and experience, yet issues remain—insufficient emphasis, personal resistance, formalism. Rotation should be based on solid research, identify problems and potential after-effects, conduct risk assessments, craft countermeasures, and implement without compromise, thereby tapping cadre potential, invigorating posts, and improving the science and efficacy of rotation for a win–win of personal growth and a stronger cadre corps."

  PRC_official_selection: "Optimize Bureaucratic Selection"
  PRC_official_selection_desc: "With U.S. division and civil war raging, Europe growing tense, and constant provocations from the pact’s vermin, the 'great changes unseen in a century' foreseen by the General Secretary are unfolding. For China’s development, waves of excellent, politically loyal Party-state cadres are essential. Our selection system still leaks—connections and back doors persist, and the Taiwan Strait conflict even exposed disloyalty among some senior officials. We must immediately perfect the selection system for cadres at all levels."

  PRC_support_forever: "Resolutely Support President Xi"
  PRC_support_forever_desc: "When the Party faced the sugar-coated bullets of corruption, it was General Secretary Xi who safeguarded the revolutionary gains; when the PLA neared a crisis of degeneration, it was he who rescued this people’s army; when legacy issues widened the wealth gap, it was he who stepped forward. After Taiwan’s liberation, Xi Jinping’s prestige peaked. Resolutely supporting his leadership is essential to national rejuvenation."

  PRC_whole_democracy: "Whole-Process People’s Democracy"
  PRC_whole_democracy_desc: "There are many Western-style democracies internationally, but democracy truly of the people has never appeared. In the 21st century, leaps in AI and big data make its practice possible. We should establish whole-process people’s democracy, improve the socialist system, and present a 'Chinese solution' to the world."

  PRC_credit_system: "Establish a Digital Credit System"
  PRC_credit_system_desc: "With the ongoing digitization and informatization of administration, we have placed every citizen’s identity data on online platforms, greatly facilitating law enforcement and curbing separatism, while benefiting the public through more efficient services; AI and voice technologies also help the elderly and those less adept online. Now we go further: build a society-wide personal digital credit system to facilitate rule-of-law nation-building, let the people share more dividends from digital administration, and strictly monitor and strike all corruption inside and outside the Party—sounding the charge for the final battle against graft."

  PRC_legislation: "Scientific Legislation"
  PRC_legislation_desc: "Good laws are the premise of good governance. With accumulated legislative theory and democratic-agenda reforms, we can now revise the Law on Legislation. We will address low public participation and uneven constitutional review standards, while emphasizing legislation, amendment, repeal, and interpretation in market order and national security, gradually enacting the new laws and regulations the people urgently need."

  PRC_law_enforcement: "Strict Law Enforcement"
  PRC_law_enforcement_desc: "Administrative organs are the state bodies closest to the people and a key link in rule of law. We can no longer tolerate arbitrary enforcement. While expanding force size, we will hold regular legal training for all levels, strengthen constraints on the use of power, and remedy long-standing shortages and ignorance of law—so enforcement is by the law and for the people."

  PRC_fairly_justice: "Impartial Justice"
  PRC_fairly_justice_desc: "Our judiciary once suffered from unprofessional adjudication and encroachment by Anglo-American systems. In a future of great rejuvenation, courtrooms must not fall to fools and pettifoggers. Judicial organs must raise the quality of adjudicators, sever improper ties among prosecution, trial, and defense, and remove incapable cadres—so the people can feel fairness and justice in every case."

  PRC_curb_bad_enterprise: "Restrain Rogue Enterprises"
  PRC_curb_bad_enterprise_desc: "Some mock the rule-of-law apparatus as 'science fiction'—an emotional charge, but we must admit that in a highly marketized sphere, workers’ rights are hard to secure. It is time to bid farewell to local protectionism. Authorities must re-wield the iron fists of the Labor Law and arbitration, and put corporate compliance inspections back on the agenda. For bosses who deceive up and down or seek improper political influence, we have ways."

  PRC_public_security: "Improve Public Security"
  PRC_public_security_desc: "Sound public security is the precondition for development and people’s safety. Without social harmony and stability, there is no national prosperity and rejuvenation.\nFrom the protracted struggle between the people and lawbreakers, we have gained valuable experience. We will use it to refine the prevention and control system and focus on a safer China at a higher level."

  PRC_public_supervision: "Strengthen Mass Supervision"
  PRC_public_supervision_desc: "The masses have keen eyes. Mass supervision has long ensured clean and efficient state organs and is an important pillar of our oversight system. Supervision is intrinsic to governance; as an external force, the people’s oversight plays a vital role and, together with other forms, creates synergy. This reflects the Party’s integrity for the public and embodies the mass line in the oversight field."

  PRC_finalbattle_anticorruption: "Skynet [GetYear]"
  PRC_finalbattle_anticorruption_desc: "Perhaps we have sacrificed too much for development—including Party purity. More cadres are estranged from the masses, bureaucracy spreads… we even allowed some so-called 'people’s entrepreneurs' to become Party members! The discipline commission must strike hard and show no mercy. If we wish to preserve harmony between the Party and the people, there can be no 'harmony' within the Party."

  PRC_remain_aspiration: "§RStay True to Our Original Aspiration and Keep Our Mission Firmly in Mind§!"
  PRC_remain_aspiration_desc: "General Secretary Xi emphasizes: 'Stay true to our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind.' What is the CPC’s aspiration and mission? 'To seek happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.' Amid great changes unseen in a century, our Party must keep its heart, maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the broadest people, and remember its mission. To 'stay true' is to remember our founding program—striving for socialism and communism—hold lofty communist ideals, strengthen the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and advance step by step toward a better future and the highest ideal."

  PRC_promote_new_energy: "§GPromote New Energy Use§!"
  PRC_promote_new_energy_desc: "Promoting the use of new energy aims to cut carbon emissions and protect the environment. Clean and renewable, new energy aids the transition of the energy structure."

  PRC_back_to_anji_village: "Return to Yucun, Anji"
  PRC_back_to_anji_village_desc: "Yucun in Anji County is where China’s modern environmental awareness rose. Here the General Secretary put forward the concept that 'lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.' To deepen environmental protection, returning to Yucun and carrying forward its experience is necessary. The General Secretary’s revisit will guide ecological protection to a new level."

  PRC_remake_northwest: "Remake the Great Northwest"
  PRC_remake_northwest_desc: "Severe desertification in the northwest affects lives—from farming to animal husbandry, from barren soils to degraded grasslands—threatening food security. Coupled with issues involving ethnic minorities and western development, remaking the Northwest is urgent."

  PRC_build_environment: "Build Ecological Civilization"
  PRC_build_environment_desc: "The General Secretary stresses: 'Environmental protection and economic development are dialectically unified and mutually reinforcing. Building ecological civilization and advancing green, low-carbon, circular development not only meets the people’s growing need for a beautiful environment, but also enables higher-quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable, and safer development—pioneering a path where production thrives, life prospers, and ecology flourishes.'\nEcological civilization is a fundamental plan for the Chinese nation’s sustainable future. Our civilization has revered nature for over 5,000 years; the Party has long prioritized eco-protection, establishing conservation and protection as basic state policy and sustainable development as national strategy. The modernization we seek harmonizes humanity and nature: creating more material and spiritual wealth to meet the people’s better life, and providing more quality ecological goods to meet their desire for a beautiful environment."

  PRC_green_golden: "§GLucid Waters and Lush Mountains Are Invaluable Assets!§!"
  PRC_green_golden_desc: "A green China is every Chinese person’s aspiration. Look at the West’s plight and imagine: a homeland strewn with garbage, swarming flies, foul stench, even E. coli-tainted water—no! That will not happen! We are advancing a green China—from Heilongjiang to Zengmu Reef, deserts to rivers to grass and trees—no locale left behind. Uphold the ecological civilization thought throughout the planting season; success is within reach. Let us loudly say 'No!' to pollution."

By integrating multi-source information—financial transactions, consumption behavior, and social compliance—it constructs an intelligent, dynamic credit evaluation framework to provide precise and efficient risk assessments for financial institutions, market actors, and public-service departments. Transcending the limits of traditional credit models, it expands coverage and speeds response through technological empowerment, excels at easing information asymmetry, advancing inclusive finance, and supporting governance modernization. China has now built, promoted, and popularized this grand system, completing key technology breakthroughs alongside institutional safeguards while continuously exploring data security and compliant application. The popularization of this Digital Credit System will become a crucial lever for building a modern economic system and a trustworthy social ecology, injecting new momentum into high-quality digital-economy development and a credit-based society."

Only innovation and creation are eternal and ever-advancing. We must dare to imagine, chart new directions with boundless imagination, and forge new miracles with inexhaustible creativity."

To build a beautiful and advanced socialist modern China in the new era, we must have the spirit to strive and act, the resolve to take on tasks, and the courage to shoulder responsibility. Complaint alone breaks the bowels; the long view counsels patience. Hesitation without action cannot build socialism. Roll up our sleeves and work hard—only concrete deeds lay the bricks of national construction."

Our indomitable spirit needs no further proof; our patriotism is etched in our hearts. Facing a world on the brink, we are confident we can defend our motherland and annihilate all enemies.

The founding of New China and great rejuvenation rest upon Party leadership, but their prerequisite is the people’s support. Without the people, there would be no victory in the Liberation War, nor the miracle of national rejuvenation.

  eco.1.t: "The Chinese Century"
  eco.1.d: "Beijing was especially crowded on this day of celebration. Following victory in the Taiwan Strait War, Tiananmen Square once again became a sea of enthusiasm. On and off camera, over a billion people nationwide held their breath. Veteran revolutionaries and foreign guests invited to the ceremony were already seated on the reviewing stand, awaiting the familiar figure of the General Secretary.\n\n\"Comrades, friends, compatriots! Today, we are holding a grand military parade to solemnly commemorate this historic milestone—the return of Taiwan to the motherland.\" Taking advantage of Xi Jinping’s well-timed pause, waves of cheers began to ripple through the crowd.\n\n\"The Chinese nation, with a civilization stretching back over five thousand years, has created countless glories in history and also endured much hardship. In modern times, our motherland suffered the humiliations of foreign aggression, division, frequent warfare, and untold suffering. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of all ethnic groups, after a hundred years of struggle, have finally washed away national humiliation. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. Facing a new stage of development, we must remain vigilant in times of peace and prepare for potential dangers. Relying closely on the entire Party, the armed forces, and the people of all ethnic groups, we will resolutely overcome all uncertain and unpredictable risks and challenges. No difficulty can stop the Chinese people from moving forward; no force can halt the historical tide of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation!\"\n\nApplause and cheers boiled over—since modern times, the nation’s humiliation had finally become the past. Salutes thundered, tears fell, and the brave ended the bitter memories of yesterday with their own hands—and will lift up China’s future with those same hands.\n\nThe midsummer wind swept through Beijing’s streets and alleys, brushed the graying temples of Xi Jinping, and caressed the flushed faces of the masses."

  eco.2.t: "Central Economic Reform Conference Opens"
  eco.2.d: "Xinhua, Beijing, December 12 — The Central Economic Reform Conference was held in Beijing from December 11 to 12. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended the meeting and delivered an important speech. Politburo Standing Committee members Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi attended.\n\nThe meeting pointed out that the adverse impact of changes in the external environment is deepening, and China’s economy still faces many difficulties and challenges: insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties for some enterprises, pressure on employment and income growth, and numerous potential risks. At the same time, it emphasized that our economy has a solid foundation, many advantages, strong resilience, and great potential; the conditions supporting a long-term positive trend remain unchanged. We must face difficulties squarely and strengthen confidence, striving to turn positive factors in all areas into tangible development results.\n\nThe meeting held that, in practice, our understanding of the laws governing economic work has continued to deepen. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for doing economic work well. At critical moments and key junctures, the Party Central Committee promptly assesses the situation and makes decisions and deployments, ensuring that the ship of China’s economy rides the wind and waves and sails steadily and far. We must properly coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that both \"lets go where appropriate\" and \"regulates where necessary.\" We must balance total supply and total demand to smooth the domestic economic cycle. We must coordinate cultivating new drivers with upgrading old ones, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. We must balance optimizing increments with activating stock, comprehensively improving resource allocation efficiency. We must balance improving quality with expanding aggregate volume, consolidating the material foundation of Chinese-style modernization. The meeting required that next year we continue to pursue progress while ensuring stability, seek progress through stability, uphold integrity and innovation, establish before breaking, integrate systems, and coordinate policies—enriching and improving the policy toolbox and enhancing the foresight, precision, and effectiveness of macro-regulation.\n\nWe must implement a more proactive fiscal policy. Raise the deficit ratio to ensure sustained and stronger fiscal support. Increase fiscal expenditures and strengthen guarantees in key areas. Issue more ultra-long special treasury bonds to continually support the implementation of the \"two heavies\" (major infrastructure and major public services) and the \"two news\" (new technologies and new industries) policies. Expand the issuance and use of local government special bonds, widening their scope and allowing use as project capital. Optimize the expenditure structure, improve the efficiency of fund use, focus more on improving people’s livelihood, boosting consumption, and strengthening momentum, and firmly safeguard the \"three guarantees\" at the grassroots level. Party and government organs must continue to tighten their belts.\n\nWe must implement a moderately accommodative monetary policy. Give full play to both aggregate and structural functions of monetary policy tools; cut reserve requirements and interest rates at appropriate times; keep liquidity ample; and align growth in total social financing and money supply with expected targets for economic growth and overall price levels. Keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and balanced level. Explore expanding the central bank’s macro-prudential and financial stability roles, innovate financial tools, and maintain financial market stability.\n\nWe must deliver a policy \"combination punch.\" Strengthen coordination among fiscal, monetary, employment, industrial, regional, trade, environmental, and regulatory policies and reform-and-opening measures; improve effective inter-department communication and consultation-feedback mechanisms to enhance policy synergy. Include both economic and non-economic policies in a unified assessment of macro-policy orientation consistency, coordinating the entire process from formulation to implementation to improve overall policy effectiveness."

  eco.3.d: "Earlier today, the CPC Central Committee held a press briefing to introduce and interpret the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee. China Media Group, People’s Daily Online, Xinhua Net, and others broadcast the briefing live. Compared with the past, this session drew unprecedented attention at home and abroad. With the U.S. civil war breaking out, China’s recovery of Taiwan, and a group of Western Pacific states forming the so-called “Pacific Defense Pact” in pursuit of regional hegemony, every move by Chinese decision-makers is under the spotlight.\n\nYears ago, before political division and civil war in the United States intensified, people on both sides of the Pacific often spoke of China-U.S. strategic competition (or great-power competition). Each country had different strengths: the United States excels at disruption—stirring up all kinds of conflicts, not only abroad but now also at home. China excels at construction—building our own homeland and a shared world for humanity. Perhaps the U.S. or other Western civilizations produced many brilliant ideas, but only China has followed the real needs of its people and the urgent demand for peace among the world’s peoples, turning those ideas into step-by-step reality.\n\nIn China’s political vocabulary, this process is defined as reform and opening up.\n\nFrom the perspective of building, the communiqué mapped out a strategic blueprint for China. It made clear that, at this key moment when changes unseen in a century are accelerating, the nation must maintain strategic composure in the truest sense. That composure means China has its own pace of development—and its own goals. The focus remains on releasing new-quality productive forces through constructive means to meet people’s needs and pave the way for the next stage of development.\n\nMeanwhile, Western countries and Japan may again label this as opposing them in various forums..."

  eco.4.t: "President Xi Visits Yucun Again"
  eco.4.d: "Yucun, Zhejiang—It was here that General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed that “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.” Now he has returned to where that green dream began. Yucun today is very different from when he last visited: the sky is bluer, the water clearer, the mountains greener. Villagers lined the road to welcome him. No one knows better than these farmers that, without then-Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi’s guidance in 2005, Yucun might still be living off quarrying, choking in the smog of mining. Guided by plainspoken village cadres, the General Secretary toured the entire village. Though small—only 4.86 square kilometers—it is a model for environmental governance nationwide. Gazing at the distant hills—once scarred by mines, now a sea of green; rivers once turbid, now shimmering with darting fish; the scenery resembles a Jiangnan watercolor. Standing before a massive stone engraved with the ten characters “Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,” he pointed out: every city and village in the country should learn from Yucun and let the “Yucun Experience” lead sustainable development forward.\n\nA thousand miles away, in a small town, Shen Xin woke from a dream and opened his phone to see the top trending topic: “The General Secretary Returns to Yucun.” He scrolled through images of Yucun past and present, the crystal rivers and verdant hills. Pulling back the curtains, he looked out to see polluting factories in his hometown being relocated and villagers planting rows of saplings along the water and slopes. It might take ten or twenty years for those trees to grow, but he believed he would one day see blue skies again, branches hung with blossoms."

  eco.5.t: "Xi Jinping Returns to Gutian"
  eco.5.d: "On a bright morning, a convoy of black Hongqi cars broke the quiet of the small mountain village of Gutian. In 1929, Mao Zedong saved the Red Army here from the brink; in 2014, Xi Jinping rectified the PLA’s conduct and discipline here, laying the foundation for victory in the Taiwan Strait; and now, the great General Secretary of China had once again returned to this humble yet momentous village. After disembarking, the group walked toward the site of the First Gutian Conference. Gazing at the eight bright-red characters “May the Spirit of the Gutian Conference Shine Forever,” he recalled what Vice Chairman Zhang Youxia had recently reported: insufficient advancement and inadequate fielding of equipment; a mood of relaxation and ease spreading among soldiers after victory in the Taiwan Strait; opportunism and arrogance taking root; and the expansion and upgrading of the armed forces of the Pacific Pact states. With these thoughts, he stepped into the old site, paying respects to the place where Chairman Mao had worked. Here, the silhouettes that led the Red Army to victory seemed still visible. As Mao’s most outstanding student, the times had thrust him into the highest position and entrusted him with a heavy mission. He had resolved one difficulty after another; now he had to decide whether the nation’s sharpest blade would slowly dull or be reforged and sharpened anew. Stepping out of the site and looking back once more at those eight characters, he made the same decision as before. Perhaps only thus could the soldiers keep their original aspiration, weather the storms to come, and secure final victory amid circling wolves..."

  eco.6.t: "“Dark Factory”"
  eco.6.d: "Southeast China, a new workshop at a production base.\n\nThe last production line in the new workshop was officially ignited, marking the commissioning of the final line under adjustment. The entire base could now run at full power.\n\nThe young engineer—no longer that young now—looked upon the shop floor with deep emotion. From first-generation lines that required workers’ 24-hour presence and labor to run; to second-generation lines that relied on mechanical automation, with workers only handling faults;\n\nTo third-generation lines that, leveraging today’s SCADA systems and newly deployed self-sensing processing technology, achieved fully automated production. Workers use the automated data system to monitor equipment and anomalies across the line; parts of the factory can run without human oversight during production—and thus most areas no longer need full-time lighting.\n\nWhat was once the blueprint concept of a “dark factory” has now been fully realized.\n\nThe workshop director, for the moment basking in fully lit floors, felt a surge of emotion. On this high-speed highway of technology, there is no silver bullet; the experience of old engineers doesn’t always work in every scenario; and empty talk of any one technology being the only way forward is unreliable. The road ahead depends only on himself—and on the hundreds of comrades above and below him on the shop floor, fighting day and night.\n\n\"You’ve been staring long enough—let’s go. We still have a production scheduling meeting after we get back.\" Someone patted the director’s shoulder, pulling him back to reality."

  eco.7.t: "Lessons from the Old Engineer"
  eco.7.d: "Ningde, Fujian—at a production base.\n\nToday was Open Day at the workshop. Workers and technicians could bring family and relatives to visit this previously tightly managed base, giving them a direct look at their loved ones’ work and bringing both sides closer together.\n\nAn engineer from the Digital Center, usually responsible for operations and maintenance, brought his daughter to tour the shop floor. After all, the base’s famously doting “Uncle Kaofu” only smiled happily in front of his own girl. In the Digital Center at the moment, only two engineers watched the big screen.\n\nThe old engineer’s hair was completely white. Supported by a younger colleague, he carefully observed each changing number; the light in his eyes was still piercing. After all, a chief engineer of thirty years doesn’t hold the fort without real skill.\n\n\"You youngsters have it much easier than we did. Back then, we had to go to the shop every day with paper and pen to record the data.\"\n\nThe young engineer bent down to listen respectfully to the elder’s teachings, and, for once, revealed a smile: \"Sir, that was ages ago. Now that we’ve got the digital system, I can see each machine’s production status right from here. It’s far more advanced than before. Different era, different industry—you can’t generalize.\"\n\nThe old engineer raised a hand and pointed to a figure. \"I don’t get all your newfangled stuff, but what’s this interruption in signal transmission?\" He rapped the young man lightly on the head.\n\nThe young engineer seated the elder on the sofa and grabbed his laptop to check the anomaly records.\n\n\"Hiss—wait, I can’t access this database even with the workshop director’s permissions. Only the Digital Center folks have access.\""

  eco.8.t: "A Day Trip to Zhuhai"
  eco.8.d: "Dignitaries from the Middle East and their entourages strolled through the Zhuhai Airshow. Looking around, the array of new-type weapons dazzled them. The dignitaries smiled—China, which strongly supports Saudi Arabia, is so powerful that if anything happens to the Kingdom, China will not stand idly by. In that moment, they felt reassured once again.\n\nIn the notebooks in their hands, models like the Wing Loong and CH series UAVs, the Hurricane 3000, the HQ air-defense missiles, and the J-35A were written down. One by one, aides \"peeled off\" from the group to visit various \"booths\" for inquiries, jotting answers in their own notebooks before rejoining—repeating the cycle again and again.\n\nThe day passed quickly. Back at the hotel, they showered to wash away the day’s fatigue. Over dinner, they chatted and laughed about arms procurement, imagining a stronger Saudi Arabia; check marks were added to the items on their shopping list between jokes.\n\nBefore sleep, the Crown Prince of Dubai replayed those weapons in his mind over and over. If equipped by his country’s forces, they would be like wings to a tiger. A smile bloomed unconsciously on his face. The funds were ready; tomorrow, they would discuss the purchase."
  eco.8.a: "\"Everything except this one and that one—we’ll take the rest!\""
  
  eco.9.t: "Whimpering Flies"
  eco.9.d: "\"The domestic political and public-opinion climate is getting more dangerous, and the police are about to investigate the employee who just died on your watch. I think we should… find another perch.\"\n\nThe early-morning phone call that woke Cao Yong left him unable to sleep. Once known as a \"national\" and \"people’s\" entrepreneur, Cao had seized a huge slice of the Chinese and even global market through ultra-low costs and prices—in other words, by squeezing workers to the limit. Executives took over 90% of dividends; Cao himself bought a good reputation by donating a sliver of profits and hiring mouthpieces. His \"success\" was a chronicle of workers’ blood and tears. After civil war broke out across the ocean, Cao’s business suffered heavy losses when it failed to evacuate in time. In a rush to restore capacity, he ordered production lines not to stop for six months; workers ran two shifts; each had to work 12 hours a day.\n\nThe \"accident\" happened as expected. A line worker suddenly suffered an acute cerebral event on his way home; his e-scooter, the birthday cake for his child still on it, flew off the overpass. The autopsy found subarachnoid hemorrhage—death by overwork.\n\nAlthough Cao had long planned to emigrate, the tense Asia-Pacific situation meant that leaving would likely mean losing the domestic market and assets for good. Yet the phone call wasn’t wrong.

  eco.10.d: "Xinhua, Beijing — In line with the Party Central Committee’s deployment and the State Council’s plan, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, led by “Made in China 2025,” is accelerating. Like a surging tide, this grand process is sweeping across every corner of Chinese manufacturing, bringing unprecedented transformation and boundless new opportunities for development.\n\nMore and more factories are shifting to intelligent production. In a large machinery manufacturer in the Yangtze River Delta, shop floors once noisy with many workers now present a spectacular scene: rows of intelligent robots quietly assembling and machining components in orderly fashion.\n\nThese robots are highly precise, keeping error margins extremely small. Connected via the Internet of Things to the enterprise’s central control system, they enable real-time monitoring and adjustment of production. According to the plant manager, intelligent production not only greatly improves efficiency and lowers labor costs, it also significantly enhances product quality.\n\nThere have been many new breakthroughs in R&D investment as well. Companies are increasing the proportion of spending on research, while cooperation among enterprises, universities, and research institutes has grown closer.\n\nGreen manufacturing concepts have also taken root. Firms once known for high pollution and energy consumption are now actively adopting environmental technologies. A traditional steel company in North China invested in a system to capture and treat exhaust gases, purifying what would’ve gone into the air and reusing it as secondary energy in other processes. Meanwhile, production workflows are continually optimized to reduce water waste and raw-material losses.\n\nInternationally, “Made in China 2025” is attracting attention and participation from around the world. Many foreign companies bring their advantageous technologies and capital in hopes of sharing the gains. At the same time, Chinese companies are going global, engaging in competition and cooperation across the world’s manufacturing landscape.\n\nAs “Made in China 2025” accelerates the march of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Chinese manufacturing is moving toward higher quality, greater innovation, greater environmental safety, and deeper integration with the world. The achievements to come are well worth our shared expectations."

Beads of water seeping from the lid’s seam told of tea that had been boiling hot hours ago, while the slightly hardened jujube cake beside it shed a few crumbs in protest at being neglected. After a while, the sounds in the room faded. The slightly stout elder slowly set his fountain pen back in its holder and let out a long, heavy sigh.\n\nTired—of course. If the top leader of Party and state were often idle, that itself would be a serious problem. Work in eastern Fujian long ago had schooled him in high-intensity routines. But since 2020, wave after wave: COVID-19, the oil shock, power-supply strains—difficulties unending; power-sector reform, the War of Liberation, Taiwan’s integration—decisions that needed his final say; and then the avalanche to follow—the Evergrande debt crisis—robbed him of sleep. America’s civil war reshaped the world order and added a few white hairs besides. Yet though the road was winding, the future stayed bright. The earlier crises had been resolved under the Party Center’s leadership and the nation’s concerted efforts; the Taiwan front had completed the cause of reunification. And today, with the final stroke of his pen, the handling of Evergrande and its chain of problems drew to a close. The weight on his shoulders eased a little with that long exhale—he could rest for a moment.\n\nHe knew clearly, however, that challenges ahead would only grow. Intelligence files on Japan had landed on his desk in recent days—not encouraging. Goals for future political, economic, and cultural development had been mapped out in meetings. Perhaps as soon as tomorrow he would again be touring, deciding, bearing greater pressures. Strangely, the more he thought on it, the lighter he felt. Yes—was this not his youthful aspiration? The great rejuvenation had never been so near. If the people could truly live good lives, if the nation could stand tall among the world’s forests of nations—what of hardship and danger? Even facing death a dozen times, he would not repent.\n\nHe pulled his thoughts back to the snacks, focusing his eyes. The future can wait; now, he would finish the treats before him and sleep well—ready for tomorrow.\n\n\"Today’s jujube cake tastes especially good.\""

As the Asia–Pacific situation deteriorated, the Army crushed foes with irresistible force; the Air Force patrolled the nation’s skies day and night; naval battle groups shielded vital sea lanes; and every force meddling in China’s internal affairs ran headlong into the steel wall of the people’s military.\n\nThe Communist Party of China proved worthy of trust. The pandemic, oil shock, and financial turmoil were brought under effective control in sequence. In the key window as the Chinese Century dawned, China maintained strategic composure, focusing on the urgent needs of the people and the nation’s future—advancing rule of law, environmental protection, university reform, and high-tech industrial layout with proud results. Corruption, once hard to rein in a decade ago, has found little foothold under the Party’s self-reform. Through the efforts of Party and people, the scroll of national rejuvenation is becoming reality; the majestic chapter of socialist modernization has begun to play.\n\nToday’s prosperity and achievements are not an endpoint but a new starting line. In this new historical stage and development pattern, Party and people will face new historical questions, continually examining present gains and future needs through the lens of development. As one of humanity’s remaining superpowers, China will shoulder its international responsibilities.

Something in the sofa poked at his back; he began to miss the leather chairs at the firm.\n\nTo put a lock on the ex-mayor’s mouth during investigation, the provincial Political and Legal Affairs secretary had personally designated this star attorney to negotiate.

  eco.16.d: "Xinhua, Guiyang (by Jiang Qiaoling) — In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology, digital credit systems—new regulatory tools—have gradually entered public view. They play an increasing role in helping governments at all levels monitor spending flows in real time, enhance fiscal transparency, and combat corruption. Traditional anti-corruption work often relies on reports and inspections, which are lagging and reactive. Digital credit systems offer new ideas and methods.\n\nGuiyang has integrated data from banking, taxation, market regulation, and other departments to build a citywide digital credit platform covering Party and government organs and public institutions and enterprises. The platform can collect and analyze the fund flows of relevant entities and individuals in real time. When abnormal transactions are detected, the system automatically alerts authorities, prompting disciplinary and supervisory bodies to intervene. Beyond being a sharp anti-corruption weapon, the digital credit system is also a key lever for strengthening government credibility. Guiyang has incorporated all fiscal revenue and expenditure into the platform and regularly discloses them to the public. Citizens can check departmental budget execution and project fund usage via mobile apps and websites—achieving truly “sunlit finances.”\n\n\"Now everyone can clearly see where government money is spent. Those of us who manage funds must be all the more cautious,\" said Finance Bureau Director Guan Lu."

They began, overtly and covertly, to propose ending the military anti-corruption drive. Some claimed, \"Most of the corrupt have already been dealt with; given the significant results, pushing further risks going too far.\" Such talk is patently absurd—and suspect.\n\nSensing the danger keenly, the Party Center moved swiftly to deploy in-depth investigations—timely, accurate, powerful—on the basis of reliability, confidentiality, and feasibility. Through the CMC Discipline Inspection Commission’s special task force and rigorous scrutiny, and with active cooperation from leading cadres at all levels, the remaining parasites in the PLA were successfully identified.\n\nThe Air Force Military Representatives’ Congress decided to strip Ding Laihang of his deputy positions on the NPC bodies and remove his seat as a deputy to the 14th NPC; the Rocket Force Military Representatives’ Congress decided to strip Li Yuchao of his seat as a deputy to the 14th NPC. In due course, they will be expelled from the Party and face legal accountability. Meanwhile, former CMC member and Director of the Political Work Department, General Miao Hua, has been suspended for investigation. Beyond these “tigers,” a swath of “flies” up and down the chain have also been addressed.\n\nThe successful conclusion of this campaign marks another powerful achievement in the PLA’s anti-corruption drive since the 2014 military reforms, reflecting the CPC and the PLA’s original aspiration and mission to serve the people. The fight against corruption is always on the road: while corruption persists, the law will grow stricter and supervision deeper—so that cadres first dare not, then do not wish to, and finally will not be inclined to be corrupt. Only then can everything truly be for the people and in service to the people."

  eco.18.d: "As environmental policies continue to take effect, the worsening trend in the Northwest has been gradually curbed. Yet to achieve fundamental improvement and sustainable development, more human, material, and financial resources must be投入.\n\nFirst, increase investment in science and technology. Desertification control is the top priority in the Northwest. We recommend dedicated funding for new technologies in sand control—for example, establishing a special research fund. With ample support, researchers can be effectively incentivized to pursue higher-efficiency, economically viable vegetation-cultivation techniques.\n\nIn certain arid areas of the Northwest, the natural environment is too harsh for conventional species to survive. For these zones, we recommend leveraging genetic engineering to cultivate drought-resistant, economically valuable plants. Once successful, such species can survive across vast arid lands, improve soils, and anchor dunes—while driving local agriculture and processing industries, thereby marrying ecological and economic benefits.\n\nThe Northwest is rich in new-energy resources, including solar and wind. We recommend deeper development and utilization: increase R&D investment, build large-scale solar farms and wind parks. Take solar: the arid climate of our vast northwestern deserts is ideal for large photovoltaic arrays feeding the regional and national grids.\n\nAs clean-energy generation rises, it will replace more traditional energy sources, cutting pollution and easing environmental pressure. At the same time, the new-energy sector has vast potential to attract investment, create jobs, and boost the Northwest’s comprehensive strength—guiding it onto a green, sustainable path.\n\nFinally, talent is key. Attract more knowledge workers to join this great cause. Local governments can roll out appealing policies—housing subsidies, financial incentives—to open a “green channel” into the Northwest. Provinces and autonomous regions should partner with universities to encourage graduates in ecology and desert governance to head west. A steady inflow of high-caliber young talent will inject lasting vitality, strengthen the teams improving the environment, and lay an unshakable foundation for continued progress."

Degradation of natural ecosystems has been broadly checked; wind-and-sand hazards have been effectively mitigated; and soil erosion has been brought under control. Over the past four decades, cumulative established forest area has reached 31.7429 million hectares. More than 45% of treatable desertified land within the project area has seen initial remediation, and over 61% of eroded land has been effectively controlled. Economically, Phase V has created some 260,000 hectares of economic forests, producing roughly 3.4 million tons of dried and fresh fruit annually, with total yearly output value of 4.08 billion yuan. The annual ecological benefit generated by the forests created in Phase V is estimated at 96.455 billion yuan. Socially, human habitats have greatly improved; ecological culture has flourished; and awareness of ecological civilization has risen. Through roadside greening and urban–rural beautification and lighting, living conditions have markedly improved. According to China’s Ninth National Forest Inventory, per-capita forest area in the project region has reached 0.26 hectares.\n\nThe “Three-North” Project is a major national strategy tied to ecological security and the Chinese nation’s sustainable future.

  neco.1.d: "The Fifth Session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference opened recently at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nXi Jinping—General Secretary, President, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission—and other Party and state leaders attended both the opening and closing meetings, joined sectoral groups to hear views, and discussed national affairs with members. The whole committee earnestly discussed the government work report and other reports, reviewed the Standing Committee’s work report, and engaged in in-depth consultative deliberations around the Party and country’s central tasks. Members stressed the decisive significance of the “Two Establishes” and recognized the new-era original ideas, transformative practice, breakthrough progress, and landmark outcomes. They resolved to take welcoming the 20th CPC National Congress—and studying, publicizing, and implementing its spirit—as a major political task for the year; to seek real results in ideological guidance, real impact in consultative suggestions, and real contributions in serving the overall situation—thus adding CPPCC strength to a healthy domestic economic environment, a peaceful and secure society, consolidation of victory in the Taiwan Strait, and a clean, upright political climate."
  neco.1.a: "A congress of unity."

  PRC_taiwanwar.1.t: "PLAAF Routine Patrols over the Taiwan Strait"
  PRC_taiwanwar.1.d: "Xinhua reports that, amid fast-shifting circumstances in the Strait, the PLA Air Force has launched joint, routine patrols over the Taiwan Strait airspace.\n\nOver 2,000 sorties of all aircraft types have conducted multilayered, wide-area, uninterrupted routine patrols in the Strait airspace. Taiwan authorities and the so-called “TA Pact” have denounced the patrols, repeatedly dispatching aircraft to interfere and frequently violating our airspace. The PLAAF has responded resolutely.\n\nThe PRC Ministry of National Defense stated: Taiwan is purely China’s internal affair. Any foreign force attempting to obstruct reunification or the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is an arm raised to stop a chariot—an aggression the Chinese people will never tolerate."
  PRC_taiwanwar.1.a: "Iron wings blot out the sky; knaves quail."

  PRC_discuss_nanhai_islands: "Discuss the South China Sea Islands"
  PRC_discuss_nanhai_islands_desc: "Amid disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines over islands in the South China Sea, China has adhered to the principle of “shelving differences and pursuing joint development.” But under today’s Asian Cold War backdrop, as allies within the same camp, we should seek a once-and-for-all settlement."

  china.360.t: "China Launches Thermonuclear Strikes!"
  china.360.d: "Wartime Urgent Bulletin\nCabinet Office, Wartime Emergency Headquarters\n\nMultiple nuclear warheads have struck key strategic areas including Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka. The capital region has suffered catastrophic damage; the central government has urgently relocated to an alternate command site to maintain minimal command functions.\n\nRemaining SDF units nationwide are regrouping. Major MSDF naval bases have been heavily hit, though some fleets evacuated early and retain limited readiness. Nationwide early-warning systems indicate the enemy may conduct a second wave. SDF AEW aircraft and surviving air defenses are being deployed in haste to intercept any follow-on attack.\n\nRemaining MSDF vessels are on heightened alert. EMP from the nuclear blasts has severely disrupted our C2 networks; communications with local units are difficult. Emergency comms are being activated to restore the most basic command links."
  china.360.a: "…Fuck."
  china.360.b: "We will have our revenge!"

  china.361.t: "Japan Struck by Thermonuclear Attack"
  china.361.d: "For the first time since Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, nuclear detonations have struck the Japanese home islands. As the war reached stalemate, China suddenly launched a massive nuclear strike on Japan. Multiple warheads detonated across the archipelago. From Hokkaido to Kyushu, major cities were hit near-simultaneously. Initial estimates suggest the total yield is dozens of times that of the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nEMP effects have blacked out communications nationwide; damage assessments continue. What is clear is that this attack has fundamentally shaken Japan’s capacity to persist as a state."
  china.361.a: "Appalling."
