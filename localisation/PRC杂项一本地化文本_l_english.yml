  china.5000.d: "“Esteemed deputies to the National People’s Congress, comrades all:\n\tGreetings!\n\n\tFirst, allow me to congratulate our Party and our country on fulfilling the mission entrusted by Comrade Mao Zedong—fully winning the People’s Liberation War and, 133 years after the First Sino–Japanese War, realizing the historic reunification of the Chinese nation. We have reached a critical node on the road to national rejuvenation, and I am confident and steadfast about China’s prospects for achieving developed socialism by 2049. The world is now undergoing profound changes unseen in a century; we will need fresh measures and new reforms—but, most importantly, the Party needs a younger cohort of leading cadres. In light of the nation’s current situation and my personal circumstances, I hereby submit to the National People’s Congress and its Standing Committee, and to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, my request to resign the posts of President of the People’s Republic of China and General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee. I believe that whoever the Central Committee and the Chinese people choose as successor, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the building of socialist modernization, and the Second Centenary Goal will be realized through the arduous struggle of the Party and the people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Xi Jinping"

His battalion commander, Chen Hao—ever the joker even in uniform—often trades barbs with him.\n\nAt Shenzhen Civic Center, red flags ripple. Citizens carry portraits of leaders, laughing as they march down car lanes and sidewalks. It is a special national holiday—no commuting, no overtime.\n\n“Comrade Chen Hao, I expect you to maintain seriousness while leading the men. This is a major event—our discipline must show!” Commander Qiu tries to keep a straight face. He isn’t very good at it; the corners of his mouth already twitch upward.\n\nUnder the gaze of other company commanders, Chen swallows a grin. Staring straight at Qiu but struggling not to smirk, he replies: “Company Commander Chen understands! No clowning around!”\n\nIn the end, everyone bursts into laughter."

  china.5252.d: "With General Secretary Xi Jinping announcing his retirement, the Communist Party of China has entrusted its own future—and that of 1.4 billion Chinese—to a new leader. Hu Chunhua, former Politburo member and Vice Premier of the State Council, has been appointed the new General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee. In images broadcast from the Great Hall of the People on CCTV, Hu addressed the flashing cameras with confidence, stating that in the new era the CPC remains the vanguard of the proletariat—and will stand as a steadfast revolutionary bulwark for working people worldwide. Confronting a complex international landscape and a dim outlook for the global communist movement, Comrade Hu declared that the CPC will shoulder its epochal responsibilities, and—on the foundation of world stability and prosperity—assist other nations’ peoples in realizing their own democratization and modernization.\n\nStorms gather and disperse. With power again changing hands in Zhongnanhai, where will the People’s Republic be led? Can the CPC of a new era guide the world toward a new direction? Time will tell."

  china.6001.t: "Battle Hymns Thunder, Engines Roar"
  china.6001.d: "The cabin lights flick on. The platoon leader’s voice crackles in your headset: “Remember your movement sequence. If anything goes wrong, stay calm—your reserve chute can save your life! It’s a quiet moonlit night with ideal weather—treat this like training and jump!” You glance down to re-check your kit when the knucklehead behind you—the one who enlisted just to drive a para-IFV—jabs your ribs: “Don’t wet your pants down there!” Even through the visor you can picture his grin.\n\nThe ramp opens; a razor wind slashes in. You rise and move toward the door. You rehearse the sequence in your head. Countless mat-slams from training flicker through your mind.\n\nThe platoon leader squeezes ahead, raises his voice to the cabin: “Comrades, the Party and the People are testing us! Move out!”\n\nYou bound into the night. Being the tallest, you always jump first. It used to spook you; now it feels like an honor bestowed by heaven.\n\nTuck legs. Cross arms… your muscles run the drill by memory—perhaps your cleanest execution yet. “Five stars from the PL,” you think.\n\nTaipei sprawls beneath, cloaked in darkness. “The Navy and Rocket Force brats must’ve had a blast,” you mutter. Your chute blossoms; HUD cues bloom in your tactical visor, marking the DZ. The lightweight WG-24S exoskeleton—built for airborne troops—pipes a full battlefield UI right to your eyes.\n\nAltitude ticks down; the drop zone swells. You draw a long, steady breath.\n\n“Heroes of the Airborne, deep behind the lines!” you hum the lyric, nail the landing, and hit the ground running.\n\nChute stowed, weapon ready. A few comrades rally up. You sprint under visor guidance to a knoll near the highway and start digging in.\n\nDrones report movement from a nearby garrison. The platoon leader barks at you to speed up—foxholes and firing points now.\n\nAt 0300, engines and headlights bloom at the far end of the road. Your grip tightens on the rifle."

  china.6000.t: "A Routine Press Briefing"
  china.6000.d: "The world reels as civil war once again engulfs North America, with brutal images of conflict and death flooding social media. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Chaoyangmen South Avenue, reporters jam every aisle. Today’s routine press briefing is, most unusually, delayed by thirty minutes. Amid a restless buzz, spokesman Wang Wenbin—temples dusted with gray—finally steps to the podium.\n\n“China’s position on the current crisis in the United States is consistent and clear,” Wang says evenly. “We call on all parties to de-escalate and pursue a political settlement.”\n\nAsked by Kyodo about Taiwan, the seasoned spokesman is watertight: “The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair and bears no relation to the current situation in the United States. Our vision for peaceful reunification remains unchanged.”\n\nWhen a Reuters reporter presses whether Beijing maintains direct channels to various U.S. factions, Wang replies swiftly and tersely: “I’m not aware of the situation you describe.”"

  china.6003.t: "Battle Report: Taipei"
  china.6003.d: "To: Central Military Commission of the PRC\n\nIn the early hours today, under joint land-sea-air fire support, our armored forces rapidly routed the enemy’s Mech Inf 269th Brigade, penetrated along Highway 1, and launched a general assault into Taipei proper. Though the enemy destroyed all external transport nodes such as Guandu Bridge and fought like cornered beasts within the city, we broke their lines and seized key nodes across Taipei.\n\nOur air assault units successfully stormed the so-called Presidential Office, apprehended the top military and political leadership of the separatist regime at Songshan Airport, and captured the enemy’s overall command, severing their control of subordinate formations.\n\nAs planned, we have combined psychological ops, propaganda, intelligence, decapitation, and infiltration to induce mass defections at the front. With the cooperation of uprising units, we have largely liberated Taipei and stabilized order. However, a sizable number of diehards have fled into the Yangmingshan and Xueshan ranges. The Xueshan Tunnel has been demolished; roads to eastern Taiwan are damaged to varying degrees. Our near-term focus will shift to mountain warfare, sweeps, and stabilization operations."
  china.6003.a: "Reunification is assured."

  china.6004.d: "A PLA brigade garrison, Fujian Province\n\nDu Fuguo stands beside the political instructor of this heroic company. Though he lost his sight years ago, he can still feel the warriors’ fervor before him.\n\n“Comrades, today we will be the cutting edge of national reunification! The Party and the People are testing us!”\n\nThunderous applause. When the instructor’s terse, rousing remarks end, he holds the mic to Du.\n\n“Hello, comrades.”\n\nSilence falls like a tide. Du reins in his emotions and speaks calmly, “Standing here today, I am deeply excited—yet deeply regretful…”\n\nA pause; a breath.\n\n“Excited that I can address the heroes who will reunify the motherland, and witness it myself. Regretful that I can only stand on this platform, in the rear—not among you.” He smiles wryly, then with renewed warmth:\n\n“So I have a request: whoever sets foot on the Treasure Island first—bring me back a handful of earth, so I can feel its soil! Better yet, take my hand and lead me there—every one of you—on your triumphant return!”\n\nHe steadies his voice, then declares:"

  china.6005.t: "CPC General Secretary and PRC President Xi Jinping Sends Condolences on the Passing of Former President of the Russian Federation\nVladimir Putin"
  china.6005.d: "Xinhua, Beijing — General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping sent a message of condolence to the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, mourning the passing of former President Vladimir Putin. The full text reads:\n\n“Upon learning of the unfortunate passing of former President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have lost a good friend. On behalf of the CPC and the Chinese people, with profound sorrow I extend our deepest condolences to the Presidential Office of the Russian Federation, to the Russian government, and to the Russian people.\n\nMr. Putin was a great leader of the Russian Federation and of the Russian people. He devoted his life to Russia’s cause, making outstanding contributions to Russia’s national development, to global governance, and to multilateralism.\n\nMr. Putin was a sincere friend of the CPC and the Chinese people. He inherited and advanced the traditional friendship between our two countries, forging deep ties with the CPC and Chinese leaders. Together with General Secretary Xi Jinping, he elevated China–Russia relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership for a new era, powerfully driving forward our friendship, cooperation, and common endeavor. The CPC, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people will always cherish his memory.\n\nWe believe that the Russian Federation and the Russian people will transform grief into strength, carry forward Mr. Putin’s legacy, and achieve new and greater successes in confronting the COVID-19 pandemic and global geopolitical challenges.\n\nChina and Russia are neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, a community of shared strategic significance. China has always regarded Russia as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and stands ready to work with Russia to further consolidate political mutual trust, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and advance the China–Russia community with a shared future, to the benefit of our peoples and to peace and development in the region and the world.\n\nMr. Putin will be immortal.”\n\n\t\tGeneral Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the People’s Republic of China\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXi Jinping"

  china.6006.t: "An Elder Statesman"
  china.6006.d: "Jiang Zemin lay in the ICU. The medical team had done everything possible; his time was short. In the hospital he recalled much—the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, the 1999 embassy bombing, the 2001 crash of 81192. He and the CPC of that era could only endure, bide their time, and keep a low profile—so that one day China could truly stand tall and never again be bullied. No one would ever fully know the pressure he bore. Yet he felt it had been worth it. Across the ocean, the once-dominant power had fallen into pieces—had he outlasted his rival? He shook his head at the thought.\n\n“Comrade Jiang…” The ICU door opened softly; a major stepped in.\n\n“The PLA has landed on Taiwan as of early this morning.” Jiang lifted his head, agitated; a doctor rushed to steady him.\n\n“The landing forces have secured the beachheads and are advancing in good order. Everything is proceeding smoothly.”\n\n“Ha… ha ha ha…”\n\nHe laughed—pure, boyish joy—as if back upon a choral stage of years long past:"

  china.6007.d: "Thanks to robust infrastructure and advanced networks, news of Taiwan’s liberation spread across China’s 9.6 million square kilometers with almost no delay.\n\nThat night, spontaneous celebrations erupted in every city and village. Some set off hidden firecrackers; the urban management officers who should have intervened simply stood by with sand buckets. Smiles were unforced and everywhere; all China was a sea of joy.\n\nAt dawn, countless people carrying flowers gathered along Chang’an Avenue in Beijing, all intent on a single destination. Though the authorities had anticipated public memorials, they underestimated the people’s fervor and had to draft more PAP troops for security.\n\nIt was the same beyond Beijing—from Shanghai to Jiaxing, from Jinggangshan to Zunyi, from Yan’an to Xibaipo—at every martyrs’ cemetery and memorial square.\n\nIn Shaoshan, Xiangtan, red flags flowed; in the memorial hall, white marble lay blanketed in bouquets. As the people filed past the crystal coffin of the elder, almost every hand held a photo—and in it the Five-Star Red Flag flew high above the former “presidential office” in Taipei."

You still sleep till 8:20 and sprint for the 8 a.m. lecture,” he shot back.\n\n“Hey, there’s a talk this afternoon in West Teaching A100—by a prof who just came over from SpaceX. You in?”\n\n“What?

You’ve raised me over twenty years; now I must walk my own path and fight for communism—that was why I enlisted.\nI’ll never forget how a boy from a small county became a respected “PLA uncle.” I’ll never forget you and Grandma waving as the high-speed train carried me to university; or that phone call when I was in Wuhan. I’ll never forget the day the commander called for English-speakers to aid the American liberation—and I was lucky enough to be chosen. It’s not that I don’t love home or our family; it’s that if my life is spent in the cause of human emancipation, it will be worthy and glorious.\nGrandma, once a sent-down youth, taught me much. You can tell her that when I left, I finally understood the poem “Beijing at 4:08.” My heart is full of the unknown and of longing. Ask Grandma if her heart felt the same when her train pulled out long ago.\nWhen I first spoke of my ideals, Father praised me as “a man for big things.” Mother, ask him—does a son like this make him proud? Can he brag a little at the table with my uncles? He’s been away more than home—tell him to await his son’s triumphal return.\n\nGoodbye, Mother! I will miss you, everyone at home, the cats and dogs and flowers. Your son is bound for America. He may return victorious; he may be wrapped in a saddle blanket; he may vanish into the wild.

Xiang Chaomin and his deputy Gao Yuan dove into a crater gouged by air-ground ordnance, their Type-192 carbines spitting flame. “Presidential Guard” troops fell one by one.

  china.6303.d: "As the smoke thins, Asia—scarred by suffering—at last knows a measure of quiet. The state that still stands amid blood and ash, as expected, is the People’s Republic of China—the ultimate victor.\n\nIn 1950, few imagined red China would dare send troops to Korea—or possibly prevail against the U.S.-led UN forces. Thereafter, from the Himalayas to the Amur, from Vietnam’s jungles to East China Sea islets, hegemons and challengers paid dearly for misjudging China.\n\nChina’s irresistible rise became a waking nightmare for its foes, who lashed out with every tool. Had those efforts not sought China’s destruction, their death throes might have earned pity. Yet the united will of the Chinese people burst every blockade. Not only did the PLA’s legend endure; through the twin cataclysms—the Taiwan War and the Greater Asia War—China won unprecedented victories. Riding the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it became one of the world’s most prosperous nations, its science at the forefront.\n\nToday’s China recalls the New China of decades past. Under Chairman Mao, the CPC weathered every trial and broke the imperialist encirclement. Now the whole of Asia is thunderstruck by a sweeping revolutionary gale. The proletariat’s roar shatters the chains of imperialism and capitalism, hauling the oppressed from the abyss.\n\nFrom the East, a crimson flame surges, consuming the rotten relics of yesterday and reducing their shackles to ash. Wherever the blaze arrives, its heat lights lands long shadowed, bathing the ancient earth in a red sheen.\n\nDear player, under your leadership the Chinese nation has climbed to a new and brightest summit in its long history, and the CPC—perhaps the world’s largest political organization—has been tempered unbreakable by your hand. In the years ahead, socialist China’s great march continues. The red sun of the East rises still. Our salute to you! The revolutionary road goes ever on; China will press toward farther horizons."

  china.5004.t: "The Final Judgment"
  china.5004.d: "From kang beds in the Northeast to arcades in Lingnan, countless eyes across China fixed on their screens. Under the courtroom’s national emblem, gleaming gold, the defendant held herself rigid, every movement caught in high definition. Public defender Zhang Wei pushed up his glasses and glanced at her, seeking the faintest remorse in Tsai Ing-wen’s unmoving posture. With her chin tipped up, she looked as if she were the victor.\n\n“The court now pronounces sentence on defendant Tsai Ing-wen.” The gavel’s thud echoed. The clerk’s pen flew—this would be one of the briefest records in PRC judicial history: facts clear, evidence conclusive, even the defense forgoing long argument. The presiding judge’s deep voice filled the hall: “While serving as head of the illegal Taiwan regime, the defendant long promoted the ‘two-state theory’ and colluded with hostile forces at home and abroad to undermine state sovereignty, creating the fact of territorial division. This court finds Tsai Ing-wen guilty of the crime of secession under Article 102 and incitement to secession under Article 103 of the Criminal Law. Given the especially grave circumstances, and pursuant to Article 113, we impose a combined, heavier penalty: death, to be carried out immediately; lifelong deprivation of political rights; and confiscation of all personal property.”\n\nA murmur rippled through the gallery. At the words “death penalty,” Tsai’s waxen frame finally trembled. She twisted her mouth and, face creasing with age, burst into a shrill laugh: “Red tyranny! You are all thugs! Barbarians!” Two bailiffs rushed up, hauling the raving figure to the door. The heavy oak closed, sealing her last cry of “freedom and democracy” outside the hall of justice forever."
  china.5004.a: "Her end is met with the applause and cheers of the Chinese people."

  china.5006.t: "Earthquake in Tibet!"
  china.5006.d: "January 7, 2025. In Dingri County, Tibet, a small town busy with the new year—cars passing, students laughing on the way to school, vigilant police on post, hawkers calling in the market—disaster struck. The ground began to heave. Panic. Buildings toppled; roads split; rocks tumbled from the hills. The county seemed frozen in time. Many were trapped in rubble; rockfalls cut roads to hard-hit villages. After the quake, grassroots Party cadres moved fast to mobilize rescue; many civilians joined in. But with roads broken, heavy machinery scarce, and supplies short, despair spread. They hoped for help—soon."
  china.5006.a: "Begin disaster relief at once!"

  china.5007.t: "PLA Marches to the Disaster Zone!"
  china.5007.d: "The commander’s order, answered as one. The Western Theater Command resolutely executed the decisions of Chairman Xi and the CMC, directing PLA, PAP, and militia to win the fight against the quake.\n\nDisaster is the order; time is life. On the quake signal, units snapped to emergency readiness.\n\n“Contact Dingri County People’s Armed Forces Dept.” “Launch UAV recon.” “Assess nearby rescue assets.” In the joint ops hall, orders flowed and video feeds returned as a joint rescue unfolded.\n\nThe Himalayas bore witness as PLA, PAP, and militia raced the clock toward the epicenter. UAVs and helicopters crossed snow peaks into the zone—their arrival steadied hearts.\n\nCounty PAFD leaders took orders over radio and led militia into aftershocks, saving a mother and child in Tonglai Village. PAP Shigatse elements rescued a girl in Senga Village. A forward Western Theater CP flew in aboard a Y-20 to unify command for military support to civil relief.\n\nCoordinates: 28.50°N, 87.45°E.\nMission: Conduct lifesaving search and rescue, properly shelter victims, ensure a safe, warm winter.\nPace: Within a day, comms, networks, roads, and power were gradually restored; victims had tents and hot meals."

  china.5008.d: "A knife-edge wind scoured the Plateau, but in the ruins of Gabu Village, Dingri County, warmth rose.\n\n“Eat your fill—come back for more if you need it!” boomed a PLA soldier inside a tent canteen.\n\n“Here, A-ma, more mutton for you—stewed till it falls apart,” a soldier said, handing a steaming bowl to a woman in her nineties. “Careful, it’s hot. I’ll top you up.”\n\nTears in her eyes, the elder murmured, “Jinzhu mami, yaku du.” (PLA, thank you.)\n\nOutside, many soldiers who’d just cleared debris sat on the frozen ground, eating self-heating rations.\n\n“Why don’t you eat in the tent with us?” a child asked a soldier, cheeks purple-red with cold, cupping a bowl.\n\nHe tousled the boy’s hair and smiled: “Because the hot dishes are for you.”"

  china.5009.t: "Progress with the Artificial Sun"
  china.5009.d: "On January 20, the all-superconducting EAST tokamak on Science Island in Hefei achieved a major result: a high-confinement (H-mode) plasma over 100 million °C sustained for 1,066 seconds—setting a new world record for H-mode operation on a tokamak.\n\nSince 2006, EAST has run over 150,000 plasma shots and, through an open-shared management model, has led internationally in steady-state plasma engineering and physics. In the 22nd experimental campaign now underway, the EAST team at the Institute of Plasma Physics, HFIPS, CAS, targeted the frontier of steady-state, high-performance tokamak operation—solving integrated core-edge physics, plasma–wall interaction, high-power heating coupling, first-wall exhaust, precision control, real-time diagnostics, active cooling, and more—to realize 100+ million °C H-mode for 1,066 seconds.\n\nMilestones in long-pulse H-mode have progressed from 30 s (2012), to 60 s (2016), 101 s (2017), 403 s (2023), and now 1,066 s (2025). Achieving gigakelvin-kilosecond steady-state H-mode strongly validates the feasibility of high-confinement steady operation for fusion power plants—marking a major inflection from basic research toward engineering practice, and pushing fusion energy development a large step forward."

  china.5010.t: "New Textbooks"
  china.5010.d: "Masashi still couldn’t adapt to how fast the world had changed: a month ago he stood under a different flag; two months later he was picking up a new ID card at the Public Security Bureau—this one carried the national emblem of the People’s Republic of China, a sight still unfamiliar to him.\n\nLife as an elementary pupil didn’t seem so different—until the third month. Humanities like history were suspended, and the math teacher who used to preach green-camp ideas was replaced by the taciturn, balding teacher from the next class. Masashi loved history and chatter; the change puzzled him, though shorter class time also meant more time to burn off energy at sports.\n\nThe school merged the fourth and fifth months into summer vacation, and Masashi enjoyed himself—new ice creams were a hit. In the sixth month, classes resumed; to his surprise, history and civics returned as well. He pored over the new textbooks. They told unfamiliar stories about the motherland and argued against separatism. The old books had been filled with negatives. Now two attitudes clashed before his eyes—which was right?\n\nHistory began. A gentle teacher with round glasses spoke standard Mandarin: “Class, we’ll start with history. Usually we go from past to present, but given the pace of change you live through, we’ll begin with the present. Turn to the last chapter: the Great Taiwan Strait War.\n\n“Class, this is a crucial period in our nation’s history, because—”"

  china.5011.t: "Taiwan’s Administrative System Improved"
  china.5011.d: "After a month of work, Taiwan’s bureaucracy has been greatly improved. The Ministry of State Security has completed comprehensive political and background vetting of civil servants, fully purging reactionaries who sought to resurrect the ‘Republic of China’ from our ranks.\n\nCentral appointments have been implemented step by step; seasoned administrators from Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang have arrived across Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu to help govern, raising our efficiency markedly.\n\nWith the CCDI’s Taiwan Task Force weaving a dense anti-graft net across the island, corruption has been contained. Every Sunday, the China Times runs another story of a ‘big tiger’ falling—significantly boosting public trust.\n\nOur governance capacity in Taiwan is now strong enough to support any degree of political reform across TP-KM."
  china.5011.a: "Under the sickle and hammer—always in the name of the people."

  china.5012.t: "The Strait’s End"
  china.5012.d: "Xi Jinping sat at the head of the vast Great Hall of the People. The red star ceiling lights blazed; cool air spilled from the vents. He recalled his father saying the early air-conditioning shrieked so loudly it drowned out the podium’s speakers. Times change; what plagued Mao and Deng had long been solved by Chinese ingenuity.\n\nThe digits on the electronic board snapped him back. Blue background, white letters—just like the thousands of proposals he’d watched over the past decade. But this time he stared at a place name written in simplified characters. Seven years ago in Singapore, when he shook Ma Ying-jeou’s hand, reporters’ mics still bore the traditional characters for “Taiwan.” Now, the questions that once forced him to tiptoe around guns and cameras would never be asked again—the seventy-year Strait crisis that troubled three generations would be swept into the dustbin of history.\n\nJoy? Excitement? Perhaps neither. He had imagined how he’d feel when this day arrived; now he knew:\n\nIt is finished.\n\n“We now vote on the Basic Law of the Taiwan Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nSilence seemed to ring in his ears. Behind him, more than two thousand eyes and hands focused on the most important, glorious law in seventy-three years of PRC history—second only to the Constitution.\n\n“Announcing the result:\n\n‘In favor: 2,977. Against: 0. Abstentions: 0. Read.’”\n\nNo one heard the word ‘against’—the hall was already swallowed by thunderous applause. Xi felt every gaze fix on him. Perhaps the NPC is not known for ‘no’ votes—but this time, every ‘yes’ was from the heart."

  china.5013.t: "Military Administration Lifted—Taiwan Province Established"
  china.5013.d: "(Xinhua, Beijing)\n\nPursuant to the decision of the National People’s Congress, and by decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as of today the military administration in Taiwan is lifted. The People’s Government of Taiwan Province of the PRC is formally established with a complete administrative framework. This opens a new chapter as Taiwan fully re-integrates into the national development agenda and joins all compatriots in the great journey of national rejuvenation.\n\nTaiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. A small group of separatists, colluding with outside forces, once endangered sovereignty and cross-strait peace, compelling necessary measures. Under the Party’s leadership, the PLA crushed separatist plots and swiftly restored order.\n\nFour months of temporary military administration ensured a steady transition from chaos to governance and safeguarded lives and property. With conditions now fundamentally improved, order stable, it is time to lift military rule and restore normal provincial administration. Establishing Taiwan Province refines our administrative map and provides the institutional foundation for long-term prosperity and stability.\n\nThe core is serving the people of Taiwan. The new provincial government will immediately tackle livelihood concerns and drive restoration and comprehensive development. Its establishment removes political and legal obstacles behind the former turbulence and secures the long-term interests and well-being of Taiwan compatriots within the framework of national unity.\n\nTaiwan’s prosperity rests on national strength; its future lies in national rejuvenation. Under the Party’s leadership and with the people’s efforts, the new Taiwan Province will thrive—sharing responsibility and glory on the road to the Chinese Dream."

  ETI_people_war_idea_desc: "States stand or fall with the people’s hearts. In ages past, King Taksin rose by arms, uniting the realms—north against Burma, south to Khmer—holding the long strategy and awing Indochina. Yet his grandson Rama II cast aside benevolence for harsh law, spurned the plough and the sword for luxury, left the people hanging upside-down—and the kingdom fell within three generations. Was this not rebellion against Heaven and the people?\nToday Rama X inherits the afterglow of the Ninth’s seventy years of benevolent rule. The late king toiled day and night, caring for farmers and commonfolk; thus the Siamese loved him even in hardship. But the new king’s misrule exceeds Taksin’s a hundredfold!\nHe breaks ancestral law—twisting ‘the king reigns but does not govern’—expands guards under pretext of plague, usurps the Privy Council on Buddhist holidays, puppeteers the Diet by secret letters.\nHe squanders the people’s fat—fleeing to Alpine villas with twenty concubines amid pestilence, buying German jets as toys, building a pleasure-palace, turning Thai sweat into Bavarian wine and Swiss deposits.\nHe disorders the rites—deposing a virtuous queen, elevating a concubine, cloistering sisters, casting off sons, profaning temples with the harem.\nWater bears a boat; it can also overturn it. Youth salute with three fingers; red shirts cite the constitution; once, millions knelt for the late king’s bier—now boys glare at the new king’s motorcade.\nThailand’s crisis is not red vs. yellow, nor generals vs. politicians, but one man’s desire against the people’s justice. May the rulers heed Taksin’s warning, reform with one heart, return power to the people—lest Thonburi’s doom revisit the Chao Phraya. —DeepSeek"

  china.5016.d: "\n\n\n£GFX_MSS_event_texticon\n\n\n\n\nRespected Chairman:\n\nPer the Central Committee’s directive, intensified collection and penetration targeting Japan has yielded initial results. Since our decisive victory in the Strait, Tokyo has escalated radical anti-China propaganda, stoking anti-communist fervor. Tactics include: exploiting casualties from their interference to push revanchism; distorting and smearing our operations; tightening content review and erecting information fences. Nationalist sentiment has surged; attacks on ethnic Chinese have spiked; mobs parade and smash Chinese-made goods.\n\nJSDF movements have become unusually frequent; conscription checks stricter; U.S. bases were illegally ‘co-administered.’ Unusual officer gatherings occurred in Tokyo and Yokohama; suspected fortifications rise at key ports. Documents indicate updated training programs and extended terms of service are approved. Risk of a militarist revival is rising; war preparations to threaten our security cannot be ruled out. The MFA has lodged stern protests; Tokyo remains unapologetic.\n\nWe recommend: authorize the Western Theater Command to initiate reciprocal readiness measures; reinforce border and maritime patrols; expedite deployment of WZ-8 recon for persistent monitoring; and direct the MFA’s Asia Dept. to file a strong demarche, releasing satellite evidence as needed.\n\nRespectfully submitted."
  china.5017.t: "MFA Spokesperson Issues Solemn Statement on Japan"
  china.5017.d: "At today’s press conference, the MFA condemned continued violence against Chinese citizens and ethnic Chinese in Japan. Rather than apologize and compensate for multiple egregious cases this year, Tokyo smears our citizens with false charges of ‘tech theft’ and ‘national security threats.’ FM Wang Yi stressed in a call with his counterpart: “Denying historical guilt and condoning xenophobic violence trample the spirit of international law. We urge Japan to strictly honor the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and to cease actions that damage bilateral ties and people-to-people feelings.”\n\nWith global turbulence—from U.S. civil war to European shocks and regional conflicts—Japanese right-wing activity has reached a postwar high. The MFA’s Consular Protection Center reminds overseas compatriots to practice ‘Three Avoids, Two Timely’: avoid high-risk areas, avoid sensitive activities, avoid displaying valuables; promptly call police and contact the embassy/consulate in emergencies. Missions have strengthened protection; Chinese in Japan can get real-time alerts via the ‘Consular Protection in Japan’ WeChat miniprogram. The PRC will always be your strong backing; any infringement on our citizens’ lawful rights will carry a price."

Four experimental combined-arms battalion groups have entered the Tawang depth area, suggesting intent to infringe our border.\n\nThese ‘elite combined battalions’ imitate a U.S.-style IBCT but show fatal flaws: heavy armor ratio (T-90S, upgraded T-72M1, Arjun Mk1A) with insufficient mech infantry and low digitization; battlefield comms still rely on legacy AN/PRC-117G radios.\n\nWe assess dual motives: divert domestic pressure from Manipur ethnic conflict and gain leverage in trade talks. However, the moves breach disengagement understandings and raise standoff risk along the LAC’s eastern sector.\n\nRecommendations: authorize the Western Theater to initiate symmetric responses; reinforce border readiness; accelerate WZ-8 high-altitude recon for persistent ISR; and instruct the MFA Asia Dept. to deliver a stern demarche, releasing satellite proofs if needed.\n\nRespectfully submitted."

  china.5021.d: "Twelve hours after seizing the port, 2nd Combined Battalion—Old Chen’s unit—was tasked as the spearhead to build a defense in depth. Leading 3rd Squad, he scouted sites for anti-armor positions.\n\n“Boss, the air force ploughed this place to the bedrock. Who’d still be alive? Anyone alive’s long gone.”\n\nThe lines were rubble after saturating fires; the coastal defense troops were shattered. No one sane would hide in a tomb.\n\n“Zip it, Xiao Li. Orders are orders. If follow-on elements take losses here, enjoy the brig.”\n\n“Okay, okay—hey, contact! Possible hostiles, trench, southwest! Orders?”\n\nThe squad shifted into a tactical formation. Near a shattered helicopter tail, they found two stranded JGSDF troops—the only survivors of a shootdown. Unarmed, they had no choice but surrender.\n\nAs the interpreter questioned them, Old Chen picked up a small satchel by the younger soldier’s feet—precautions. “Two tags, a towel, a folding fan… and a colorful ticket… Dezhu would love this junk.”\n\nThinking of his college-age son, a rare smile crossed his face.\n\n“Liu Hu, status?”\n\n“Sir, left-hand POW: Tanaka Yamato, nineteen. Right-hand POW: Oda Mahide, twenty-one. Both privates. They say most of their force has fallen back; their bird was hit by our Tianyan-90.”\n\nGood news—the line was secure.

  china.5022.d: "Before dawn, the hangar’s xenon lights washed the frosted apron in a ghastly white.\n\nLin Rui rapped the Z-20’s fuel gauge; the tinny ring jolted Qi Xiaochuan awake from under a wing. The rookie’s camo collar was crusted with sweetened instant soy milk—at altitude the boil’s too low, and the mess hall’s double-sugar packs always splatter.\n\nOld Zhou was misting anti-ice on the tail, beard catching tiny shards of frost. “Check the heater filaments on the respirators—three times! Last year Snow Fox’s No.3 rotor froze; we fished them out for two hours. You don’t want that experience.” Through the white plume of his spray gun, he noticed Qi’s trembling fingers tying a small bronze bell to his rucksack. Its inner wall bore a number—the token of an unnamed soul who slept forever in these mountains.\n\n“Lin, why’d they suddenly transfer us back out here? Didn’t the CO say we’d just rotated inland for two years?” Unlike the veterans, Qi had never long-stationed in a place like this; confusion and complaint leaked out with his breath.\n\n“No idea. CO said something big’s coming—something about the Yankees. Organization wants us here. What, getting cold feet?”\n\n“Come on, Lin—joined up to guard the frontier from the front… it’s just—this place bites. Gotta adapt.”\n\n“Knew you weren’t the type to shirk.” Lin slid a curled family photo into the panel gap, straightened the strobe cluster. Qi hefted the signal-flare crate—when a heavy palm landed on his shoulder. “Another tip, kid: ‘Using a flare to warn off intruders generally doesn’t count as opening fire.’” The centipede scar along Lin’s jaw twitched under the cold hangar lights.\n\nEngine run-ups shook icicles from the rafters; Qi heard the bell’s thin sob in the wind. Old Zhou holstered the sprayer and handed over a bent slab of chocolate. “Swallow. Sweeter than oxygen at five thousand meters.”\n\nThe PA cracked: “Snow Eagle Squadron—wheels up in five minutes!”\n\nAs Lin pulled down his goggles, Qi watched his Adam’s apple bob. “You’ve got the sharpest eyes, Qi—keep them on the ground. Anything odd, you call it.”\n\n“Copy.”"

  china.5023.d: "Patrol vehicles crawled above five thousand meters; the men stayed razor-alert. The silent plateau outside was the homeland they bled to protect. Since April 2020 the other side had violated accords—bridging streams, pushing roads, repeatedly crossing to contest control, seeking to change the status quo unilaterally. In June, they brazenly broke consensus and provoked across the line. Following established practice, Regimental Commander Qi Fabao went forward with just a few men to negotiate in good faith—only to be ambushed by premeditated violence. Qi directed his troops to both negotiate and seize favorable ground, then fought to the last breath against forces many times their number. Reinforcements arrived in time; overflying helicopter elements spotted the contact and provided immediate support. Our troops fought fearlessly and routed the intruders; the enemy fled in confusion, leaving their dead and wounded on our side of the line.\n\nIn the advance and fierce struggle, Commander Qi Fabao led from the front and was gravely wounded. Battalion Commander Chen Hongjun, Sergeant He Jun, and Private Chen Xiangrong broke through to rescue him and were swarmed by large Indian forces. Private Xiao Siyuan escaped the encirclement but turned back to save his comrades, fighting on until victory before collapsing. Private Wang Zhuoran, moving up to reinforce, plunged into the torrent to save a swept-away comrade and nearly drowned in the ice river. Private Qi Xiaochuan first spotted the valley skirmish, guided his squad to support, and pulled comrades from danger.\n\nThe Central Military Commission awarded Qi Fabao the title “Heroic Border-Guard Regimental Commander,” and Chen Hongjun and He Jun the title “Heroes Guarding the Motherland’s Border.” Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan, and Wang Zhuoran received first-class merits. Qi Xiaochuan’s squad received a collective first-class merit, and Qi individually a second-class merit.\n\nHeroes pass, but their spirit keeps watch. Inspired by them, the troops more firmly shoulder the duty of the border guard. Every conscript in the regiment extended to stay; special operations units volunteered to deploy to the frontier."

  china.5024.t: "Eagles Return to the Nest"
  china.5024.d: "Qi Xiaochuan’s temples still throbbed; under his tactical glove the web of his thumb burned from the flare’s backblast. He’d only caught a glint—metal, maybe—and, erring on caution, guided the team to check. They stumbled onto an intrusion and, under the captain’s command, joined the fight. With special-operations kit and air-to-ground support, they covered the troops on the ground. Lin’s strobe cluster stalled the enemy’s push; Old Zhou’s smoke sowed chaos; Qi remembered Lin’s words—at the critical moment he fired flares to lay a scorching barrier, buying time until support arrived. Everyone played their part; the intruders were thrown back.\n\nThe guys said he’d earned big merit. Compliments buzzed around him; Old Zhou’s heavy palm kept “massaging” his sore shoulder; Lin even hummed a wildly off-key marching song. His head swam; vision blurred; he’d strained his arm yanking a comrade from the torrent. The captain checked the drenched man’s condition; Old Zhou produced—another chocolate bar.\n\n“Kid poured it all into covering and rescuing. Just now he was ready to go in with a knife, then dove into the river. Now that we’ve stood down—nerves relax, adrenaline ebbs—of course he’s wiped. Come on, top up.”\n\nChewing chocolate still warm from a glove, he finally smiled. Slow, but deep—not for medals he might expect, not for first-battle pride. It was a joy that rises unbidden—when magnesium light laced the Manle River, when his frozen fingers locked a comrade’s wrist and hauled him from the flood. Something hotter than any citation burned a clear happiness into his throat along the melting path of cocoa.\n\nAfter offloading medical kits to brothers in the valley, Snow Eagle Two turned for home."

Sergeant He Jun was wiping his dagger when the outpost door burst open.\n\nHe clenched the blade and looked up—only to see his battalion commander, Chen Hongjun.\n\n“Trouble!” Chen was drenched in sweat, too rushed to wipe his brow. “The regimental commander is in a fight with the Indians in the Galwan Valley!”\n\nHe Jun sprang from his chair without hesitation and bolted after Chen.\n\nOutside, trucks were already packed with rushing soldiers—some he knew, others he didn’t. There was no time for greetings. The moment He Jun slammed the door, Chen floored the accelerator and they shot out of camp.\n\nScenery whipped by. Soon the roar of voices reached them.\n\n“Chen Xiangrong! Xiao Siyuan! Shield the commander!” As He Jun jumped down, the battalion commander and two soldiers seized shields and plunged into the dark mass ahead. He snatched up a big stone and charged into the melee.\n\nStones hissed through the night. He ducked—straight into an onrushing Indian soldier. They collided and fell. Ignoring the pain, He smashed the stone into the man’s face. A scream; the enemy who’d tried to rise fell rigidly back.\n\n“Commander!” He grabbed the Indian’s club and dashed toward the center.\n\n“He Jun, it’s dangerous—stay back!” boomed the voice of Regimental Commander Qi Fabao. He followed the sound and saw a black-tower silhouette swinging a cudgel, dropping another attacker.\n\n“They’ve got numbers!” It was the squad’s “baby-faced private,” Chen Xiangrong.\n\n“Party cadres with me—hold the front!” Chen Hongjun roared. “Conscripts, fall back! Don’t fear them!”\n\nThe battle cries of the PLA shook the valley. He Jun’s heart pounded. As he pushed toward the commander, a stone slammed into the back of his head. He tumbled, dazed. A tall Indian with a leer raised a club—\n\nA dull thud. No pain came. He rose; the enemy slumped to the ground.\n\n“Watch it, Brother He!” A PLA trooper—club stained red—grinned. He knew him: Wang Zhuoran of the mech-infantry battalion.\n\n“Thanks, brother!” He Jun blocked another sweeping club, then kicked hard; the Indian folded, clutching his groin.\n\n“Form up!” the commander’s voice rolled again. “Prepare to counterattack!”\n\n“Understood!” He Jun answered, forming three-man cells with nearby troops and pushing toward the commander and battalion commander. The enemy’s numeric pressure shattered in an instant. The valley rang with PLA shouts and the enemy’s panicked wails.\n\nHe lost count of how many foes he’d dropped. Briny blood and sweat ran to his lips. He didn’t know how much of it was his; from the Indians’ looks, he must have been terrifying.\n\n“He Jun, you’re here!” He reached the commander’s side. Under the battalion commander and several soldiers’ guard, Qi Fabao was still laying men low.\n\n“Here, Commander!” He tossed aside his snapped cudgel, drew his dagger, and drove it into a chest. “Friendly helos are inbound—we can cut loose and thrash these beasts!”\n\n“Thirty-one… thirty-two… thirty-three…”\n\nDawn painted Galwan red. The ground was strewn with twisted, groaning foes. He Jun watched, elated, as comrades bound the prisoners and stretchered the wounded for treatment and interrogation. He knew they had won—and won big.\n\n“Qi Fabao, report.” The radio crackled. “Status?”\n\n“Headquarters, we captured or incapacitated 120 enemies—with zero casualties on our side!”"

  china.5015.t: "PLA Occupies Delhi"
  china.5015.d: "Tires crushed rotting wreckage; after the inferno, Delhi showed no signs of life. Slums? Mansions? After fire, all was the same—black, flaking ruin.\n\nChen Hongjun frowned at the window, finger rubbing his trigger guard as the stench clung to his mask. The PDT’s scorched-earth plan had slowed the PLA with fire and filth—until a cloudburst drowned the flames. Now they prayed the reek would stall the soldiers’ advance.\n\nPunch through charred towers, plow aside fallen shacks, roll over the carrion—the convoy pushed on. Clear barricades, bury the nameless dead, collect the abandoned arms—the convoy pushed on. Slow the pace, part the writhing smoke, aim for the distant dome—the convoy pushed on.\n\nTracks ended at the crossroads. The Lion Capital loomed ahead. Chen gathered himself, stayed sharp, and stepped down.\n\n“Cough—ugh… what is that? How can it be this vile?” Even the hardiest gagged. Chen Xiangrong quickly handed over a respirator.\n\n“Sir, you forgot this.”\n\nMask on, quick sweep—Xiao Siyuan’s veins bulged as he fanned away the fetid air. Others were badly affected. Worse than expected. They’d have to hurry.\n\n“Sir, that’s the Parliament building ahead.” Wang Zhuoran tightened his grip on the flagstaff.\n\n“Good. All units—tactical formation, move. Let’s finish this.”\n\n…\n\nIn the smoky sunset, a red banner unfurled high—the bright crimson field, five golden stars."

  china.2013.t: "Demolish the Yasukuni Shrine"
  china.2013.d: "Infamous for enshrining numerous Class-A war criminals, Yasukuni Shrine has long been a thorn in East Asia’s side. After the Taiwan campaign, it became a symbol of Japan’s militarist revival.\n\nPost–WWII, to serve anti-communist aims, the U.S. never fully prosecuted Japan’s war criminals, enabling a disgraceful resurgence of militarism. Tokyo denies wartime crimes, rewrites textbooks, and misleads its people.\n\nThat folly has brought Japan to ruin. Tokyo is liberated, and defeat is only a matter of time. Now is the moment to level Yasukuni and formally open the reckoning.\n\n“Explosives emplaced!”\n“Perimeter clear—no civilians in the blast zone!”\n“Comrade General, charges ready!”\n\nIn dress uniform, a gold aiguillette and a first-class merit on his chest, the engineer battalion commander reported to General Zhang Youxia, likewise in full dress.\n\nAll Asia—and the world—watched to see how China would deal with a defeated Japan. Under countless lenses, General Zhang took the remote. He looked at the shrine steeped in sin and thought of fathers who fought invaders with millet and rifles—and of the millions sacrificed to win a pyrrhic victory; of PLA officers and men who had fallen in this war…\n\nHis graying temples did not waver. He pressed the switch. With a thunderous roar, Yasukuni collapsed inward to rubble.\n\n“I declare the demolition a success,” he said evenly, tamping down emotion."

  china.6888.t: "Academician Yuan Longping Passes Away"
  china.6888.d: "On May 22, 2021, Yuan Longping passed away in Changsha at the age of 91.\n\nPioneer of hybrid rice, he was the first to harness heterosis in rice, dedicating his life to “developing hybrid rice to benefit the world.” He drove innovation and spread the technology worldwide, tilling knowledge and reaping abundance—for grain, for the people. A knight of benevolence; a gentleman of the nation.\n\nHe visited IRRI 30 times for collaboration and traveled over ten times to India, Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and beyond to guide hybrid rice. The crop is now introduced or demonstrated in 20+ countries, a major Chinese contribution to fighting hunger.\n\nEver pushing yield limits, in Oct 2020, at Dongying’s saline field, “seawater rice” peaked at 860 kg/mu, a national best. New plantings had gone in—but he did not live to see them ripen."

  china.6890.t: "The Year of Mamba"
  china.6890.d: "Normally the base would be dark at this hour—only a few pinpricks of light. Tonight, the whole twelfth floor glowed.\n\n“Leadership wrapped the safety meeting—here comes another flight-safety clampdown. Standards are skyrocketing.” Luo Yi grimaced, crunching flight data at speed.\n\n“No kidding. America’s planes have been falling like wheat this year. Every crash ‘news’—first thing I check is the date, and it’s always current!” Liang Long hung up after shuffling pilots. “They’re short on people—and on basics. No wonder they imploded.”\n\n“Cracked me up yesterday. Ball with the guys—they said Nike’s touting the ‘Year of Mamba,’ LA just got torched into a court for ‘the warden,’ and now he’s gonna elbow some bros courtside.”\n\nLaughter.\n\n“Enough!”\n\nTeam lead Lin Ya’s voice froze them.\n\n“Boeing’s bankrupt from the U.S. civil war. Our Boeing fleet is grounding; C919s are taking their routes. If you’ve time to joke, go reconcile the fleet changes. Are the safety rates computed? Next month’s capacity ready? Nobody leaves until it’s done.”\n\n“Yes, boss—running the numbers—”\n\n“Just reassigned a 787 to a 919—”\n\n“My system hasn’t refreshed yet—”\n\nLin set down her coffee and stared at the aircraft spreadsheet. The C919 count rising like a straight line made her smile—tired, but proud."
