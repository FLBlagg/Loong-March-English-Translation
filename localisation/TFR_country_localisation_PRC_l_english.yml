  # Public Health: COVID-19 Measures & Policies
  # =========================
  PRC_lockdown_wuhan: "Lockdown of Wuhan"
  PRC_lockdown_wuhan_desc: "As panic spreads, the situation is slipping out of control. Since CCTV reported the discovery of a “novel contagious coronavirus,” mass outflows have begun across Hubei Province centered on Wuhan. Citizens are scrambling to flee the city; the expressways are jammed to a standstill. If we do nothing, hospitals nationwide will be reporting many more infections within days. We must act decisively and order a full lockdown of Wuhan now."
  PRC_nationwide_lockdown: "Nationwide Epidemic Controls"
  PRC_nationwide_lockdown_desc: "This will be unprecedented in public-health history—China will enter a “quasi-wartime posture” nationwide, imposing strict limits on personal travel and transport to curb viral spread. Citizens infected with coronavirus will be centrally isolated and treated in hospitals and temporary medical facilities. Meanwhile, medical and biological researchers across the country will be mobilized to pool wisdom and find a definitive solution to defeat the virus."
  PRC_implement_emergency_measures: "Enact Emergency Measures"
  PRC_implement_emergency_measures_desc: "In a national crisis, all people should stand together. Yet, as expected, unscrupulous anti-Party elements and profiteers are sowing rumors, slandering the Party and government, and sabotaging our control efforts. We will not be gentle: the People’s Police will immediately crack down on hoarding and price-gouging of medicines and masks. At the same time, tighter cyberspace controls will prevent the public from being misled and incited."
  PRC_implement_widespread_testing: "Roll Out Mass PCR Testing"
  PRC_implement_widespread_testing_desc: "PCR testing is inexpensive, easy to scale, and enables faster diagnosis of coronavirus infection—critical for timely treatment, surveillance and control, and restoring the economy and normal life. We will roll out testing nationwide and build multiple testing sites in major cities. Government personnel first; in time, all residents—and ultimately all citizens—will be tested."
  PRC_economic_stability_policy: "Economic Stabilization Policy"
  PRC_economic_stability_policy_desc: "COVID-19 has heavily disrupted normal economic order and production, seriously slowing growth—potentially undermining our goal of building a modern socialist power by mid-century. With the world struggling yet our epidemic initially contained, it is time to return the nation to the path of development and further consolidate our status as the “world’s factory.”"
  PRC_zero_covid_policy: "Uphold Zero-COVID"
  PRC_zero_covid_policy_desc: "Facing the pandemic, the Party and government have always put people’s lives and health first. For the people, we must, under the strong leadership of the Central Committee, fully uphold the zero-COVID policy. The strict early measures have proven effective. Those calling for relaxation now either fail to grasp the virus’s danger or harbor ulterior motives. We will continue to implement zero-COVID—“people first, life first.”"
  PRC_adopt_the_swedish_model: "Study the Swedish Model"
  PRC_adopt_the_swedish_model_desc: "As the first country to officially declare the pandemic over, Sweden’s policies have drawn global attention. Some of our health officials and physicians advise we study their approach: easing public-venue restrictions, halting daily case disclosures, and foregoing mandatory PCR testing for non-medical staff and low-risk groups. As transmissibility and virulence wane, this could speed our return to normal."
  PRC_kickstart_vaccine_research: "Kick-start Vaccine R&D"
  PRC_kickstart_vaccine_research_desc: "We will order national research institutes and pharmaceutical firms to immediately begin research and trials for a COVID-19 vaccine—not only to control the epidemic faster, but also to elevate our international standing and influence. Multiple candidates, including Sinovac’s inactivated vaccine, are already in clinical trials. We have also informed WHO and developing countries that we are willing to donate vaccines and cooperate on research."
  PRC_adopt_strict_lockdown_measures: "Impose Stricter Lockdowns"
  PRC_adopt_strict_lockdown_measures_desc: "Despite preparations, the virus’s transmissibility exceeds expectations. We must further tighten controls, devote more resources, and minimize internal, rural-urban, and cross-border movement. Some accuse us of “forcing a national shutdown,” but to defeat the epidemic, firm lockdowns will prove necessary."
  PRC_focus_on_vaccine_development: "Focus on Vaccine Development"
  PRC_focus_on_vaccine_development_desc: "Only by fielding a reliable vaccine can we control viral transmission at its source. Led by Sinovac and other biopharma firms, vaccine R&D has made decisive progress. We must allocate funds and resources wisely to accelerate development and deployment so that our people are ultimately protected from infection."
  PRC_focus_on_mask_production: "Prioritize Mask Production"
  PRC_focus_on_mask_production_desc: "Medical masks are inexpensive, mass-producible, and easy to distribute nationwide. Adequate mask supply is a key pillar of stabilizing the epidemic. The State Council will fund expansion of medical mask capacity—especially technical support and subsidies for manufacturers in hard-hit regions."
  PRC_food_safety_reforms: "Food-Safety Reforms"
  PRC_food_safety_reforms_desc: "Given that this unfortunate outbreak likely began with a “patient zero” consuming wild game, it is time for sweeping reform of food safety and hygiene. We will legislate to eradicate consumption of wild animals and promote hygienic table etiquette to reduce public-venue transmission. We will also invest further in industrial and convenience-food processing to make products safer and cleaner."
  PRC_surveillance_state_contact_tracing: "State-Run Contact Tracing"
  PRC_surveillance_state_contact_tracing_desc: "After the outbreak, we launched the “Health Code” location-tracking app as an e-pass and proof of health status, indicating each user’s epidemic risk level. Only with full, real-time tracking of high-risk groups under government control can we formulate effective policy while ensuring critical national-security data and citizens’ personal information are not leaked."
  PRC_outsource_contact_tracing: "Outsource Contact Tracing"
  PRC_outsource_contact_tracing_desc: "After the outbreak, we launched the “Health Code” location-tracking app as an e-pass and health-status certificate that shows personal epidemic risk. To reduce administrative burden and costs, we can entrust operations to trusted private internet companies so they share the load."
  PRC_miandian_tundi: "Intervene in Myanmar..."
  PRC_miandian_tundi_desc: "If we cannot end the war quickly, Myanmar will become a bottomless pit."
  PRC_fund_crowd_immunity_studies: "Fund Herd-Immunity Studies"
  PRC_fund_crowd_immunity_studies_desc: "As vaccination rates climb, population immunity has markedly improved. A key premise of herd immunity is that as the share of immune individuals rises, transmission chains are more easily broken and nationwide impacts fade. We will task our medical experts and major media to prepare theory and public messaging in advance of any policy pivot toward herd-immunity strategie
  
  PRC_blame_the_americans: "Turn the Question on the U.S."
  PRC_blame_the_americans_desc: "Since the full outbreak of COVID-19, Western powers led by the United States have tirelessly pushed the term “Wuhan virus” and demanded that we “compensate” for their losses. Now the tables have turned: the Fort Detrick (Maryland) biolab has been spotlighted, and many citizens in both countries are questioning whether it is connected to the pandemic—even launching open letters. We can seize this moment to ask the U.S. government why it continues to obfuscate."

  PRC_blame_local_officials: "Hold Local Officials Accountable"
  PRC_blame_local_officials_desc: "At the onset of the outbreak, some local governments papered over risks to protect their performance records, leaving us unprepared when the epidemic hit. We now see that certain cadres “report only good news.” The CCDI will comprehensively audit the past years’ work and documents of all levels of government, focusing on punishing local officials who were lax in implementing central policy or maintained improper ties with pharmaceutical firms."

  PRC_expand_the_social_safety_net: "Expand the Social Safety Net"
  PRC_expand_the_social_safety_net_desc: "The epidemic offered a sobering lesson. Many who died were impoverished and socially isolated, especially the elderly, in both rural and urban areas—exposing shortcomings in our social security system. To realize common prosperity, we must craft a more complete safety net that provides timely support for those in need."

  PRC_return_to_normalcy: "Return to Normalcy"
  PRC_return_to_normalcy_desc: "After years of effort, today we can announce to our people and the world: China has emerged from the era of the COVID-19 pandemic and officially returned to normal. This is not only a victory for the CPC and the PRC, but also a great triumph achieved by 1.4 billion Chinese people!"

  PRC_control_the_oil_crisis: "Contain the Oil Crisis"
  PRC_control_the_oil_crisis_desc: "A sudden oil crisis has hit our economy hard. Stocks plunged within a week, panic exceeded worst-case expectations, many companies collapsed, and foreign capital began weighing exit risks. Our vaunted transport system has stalled for lack of fuel. The Party has ordered immediate economic repair—yet where to start remains a tangle."

  PRC_crack_down_on_left_radicals: "Crack Down on Ultra-Left Radicals"
  PRC_crack_down_on_left_radicals_desc: "Predictably, opposition forces are exploiting the crisis to pressure Party leadership for reforms and power concessions. Long-time critics of reform and opening—ultra-left radicals including retired cadres, academics, and disaffected youth—are clamoring for a return to Mao-era egalitarianism and denouncing the current “revisionist” line. Measures are required."

  PRC_crack_down_on_reformist_protesters: "Crack Down on Reformist Protesters"
  PRC_crack_down_on_reformist_protesters_desc: "Predictably, opposition forces are exploiting the crisis to pressure Party leadership for reforms and power concessions. Many capitalists publicly claim excessive state intervention and crackdowns on private enterprise caused the collapse—echoed by intra-Party reformists and young intellectuals. They must learn to hold their tongues."

  PRC_empower_the_50_cent_army: "Safeguard the Online Environment"
  PRC_empower_the_50_cent_army_desc: "Online commenters who often voice support for the Party and government are popularly nicknamed “50-centers,” implying they praise authorities for trifling pay. Regardless, they play a key role in guiding online discourse. In times of opinion crises, this tactic has proven effective—and this time is no exception."

  PRC_concessions_to_corporate_demands: "Concessions to Business"
  PRC_concessions_to_corporate_demands_desc: "The Party’s governance capacity faces a stern test. If business discontent grows, development cannot be assured. We will make measured concessions: pro-business policies such as tax cuts and debt relief, and curbing online vilification of entrepreneurs. Without enterprise-driven GDP, China cannot be a superpower."

  PRC_concessions_to_populist_demands: "Nationalist Messaging"
  PRC_concessions_to_populist_demands_desc: "The Party’s governance capacity faces a stern test. If popular discontent grows, stability cannot be assured. We will make measured concessions by permitting certain protests and demonstrations as outlets for grievance. After all, nationalist and populist slogans cost us little."

  PRC_stabilize_the_political_sphere: "Stabilize the Political Sphere"
  PRC_stabilize_the_political_sphere_desc: "Though dissent has not vanished, we have broadly stabilized the political landscape, ensured majority support for the Party and the General Secretary, and accommodated key intra-Party factions and interest groups. This lays a solid foundation for our next steps."

  PRC_contain_the_damage: "Contain the Damage"
  PRC_contain_the_damage_desc: "Securing domestic stability first will allow us to pursue reforms more effectively to weather the oil crisis and restore national strength. China has never needed unity and strong leadership more than today."

  PRC_a_broken_system: "A Broken System"
  PRC_a_broken_system_desc: "We must admit the oil shock has exposed the current system’s shortcomings and fragility. Extraordinary times call for strong medicine: embrace bolder reforms and cut deep into outdated structures. Only then can true national rejuvenation follow."

  PRC_expand_domestic_oil_production: "Expand Domestic Oil Production"
  PRC_expand_domestic_oil_production_desc: "In this perilous moment, we cannot rely on unstable import routes. We will further tap domestic reserves and build more drilling and refining capacity. Energy security must be in our own hands; shorter logistics will also lower costs and soften the crisis’s blow."

  PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade: "Diversify Oil Trade"
  PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade_desc: "With major producing regions in turmoil, securing stable import channels is vital. Thanks to long-standing ties with developing nations, we can open additional routes—e.g., imports from Venezuela and Brunei—to spread risk."

  PRC_drill_for_xinjiang_oil: "Drill Xinjiang Oil"
  PRC_drill_for_xinjiang_oil_desc: "Xinjiang’s vast lands have hosted oil extraction for years, but remoteness and sparse population limited effective utilization. Now, with rapid approval of pipelines and new extraction contracts, Xinjiang oil has become a lifeline for our economy."

  PRC_south_china_sea_expansion: "Stabilize the South China Sea"
  PRC_south_china_sea_expansion_desc: "The South China Sea holds abundant energy reserves—enough to carry us through the crisis. We should intensify exploration and development there to ease our immediate strain while maintaining regional stability."
  
  PRC_synthetic_oil_investments: "Invest in Synthetic Oil"
  PRC_synthetic_oil_investments_desc: "In the current shortage, synthetic petroleum looks attractive. For us, it is relatively low-cost, can be produced quickly at scale, and offers performance comparable to conventional oil. Though stability issues remain, synthetic fuels have already become the primary energy source for many plants along the eastern seaboard—and adoption is spreading."

  PRC_gambit_in_the_gulf: "Gambit in the Gulf"
  PRC_gambit_in_the_gulf_desc: "To solve a problem, address its roots. We will deepen our presence in the Gulf region and more proactively safeguard our core interests there. By engaging regional governments directly and providing support to stabilize local conditions, we aim to end the crisis’s negative impacts on oil supply."

  PRC_stabilize_the_economic_sphere: "Stabilize the Economy"
  PRC_stabilize_the_economic_sphere_desc: "We can blunt the oil shock through multiple tools: limit fuel price growth, issue fuel vouchers to curb inventory drawdown, and deliver relief funds and bonds to hard-hit areas to arrest contraction. A package of coordinated measures will demonstrate our capacity to steady the economy."

  PRC_southeast_asian_bailout_package: "Southeast Asia Relief Package"
  PRC_southeast_asian_bailout_package_desc: "With smaller reserves and weaker economies, Southeast Asian nations saw sharp downturns as the oil crisis began. We can expand our influence with ASEAN by boosting trade and support to stabilize their economies and politics—projecting the image of a responsible major power."

We will spotlight model citizens to strengthen patriotic pride among the masses."

  PRC_rejuvinate_the_nation: "Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation"
  PRC_rejuvinate_the_nation_desc: "We are emerging from the oil crisis’s shadow: growth is returning, foreign reserves stabilizing, and investors are coming back. Renewed prospects and rising national pride prove once more that no hardship can defeat the Chinese people. National rejuvenation is within reach."

  PRC_a_renewable_revolution: "A Renewable Revolution"
  PRC_a_renewable_revolution_desc: "We cannot rely solely on restored oil imports. Fortuitously, rapid advances let us better harness wind and solar to offset losses from oil shortages. Wider adoption will also cut pollution and create jobs."

  PRC_a_nuclear_revolution: "A Nuclear Revolution"
  PRC_a_nuclear_revolution_desc: "Our economists and scientists advise stepping up investment in nuclear power to drive industry and the broader economy. Some raise safety and environmental concerns—but at a critical moment, wavering is not an option."

  PRC_shake_up_the_politburo_desc: "Through sustained effort under Party leadership and unity among all ethnic groups, we achieved decisive victories against COVID-19, the oil crisis, and power-sector reforms. With lives and livelihoods secured—and as U.S. turmoil deepens—this is a moment for bold strategy. Convene the 6th Plenum to review gains and chart major policies ahead."

  # =========================
  # Taiwan Strait Campaign
  # =========================
  PRC_the_final_opportunity: "The Final Opportunity"
  PRC_the_final_opportunity_desc: "After more than seven decades of stalemate, U.S. domestic turmoil has removed the largest obstacle to national reunification. Though Japan and others claim they will “maintain the status quo,” their economies and militaries cannot match ours—and without U.S. leadership, coordination is doubtful. This is the best—and perhaps last—moment to begin the liberation of Taiwan."

  PRC_blockade_taiwan: "Blockade Taiwan"
  PRC_blockade_taiwan_desc: "We will declare exclusion zones around the island and deploy escorts and submarines to patrol designated boundaries day and night. Air routes to Taiwan will be tightly monitored. This clears civilian interference for our operations, severs the island’s economic lifelines, and erodes the authorities’ grip. Some will decry a “humanitarian crisis,” but once the island collapses, the conflict will end swiftly."

  PRC_operation_silent_dawn: "§YSilent Dawn Operation§!"
  PRC_operation_silent_dawn_desc: "The decisive moment has come. We will launch Silent Dawn, a crucial step for campaign success. Rocket Force ballistic missiles and rocket artillery will preemptively strike Taiwan’s key military targets—airfields, SAM sites, and radar—to break early warning. Power plants, substations, and major communications hubs will also be targeted."

  PRC_plan_on_high_alert: "PLAN on High Alert"
  PRC_plan_on_high_alert_desc: "Since initiating blockade and patrols, the Navy’s critical tasks include thwarting breakout attempts by Taiwan’s fleet and countering harassment by hostile forces such as the U.S. 7th Fleet and JMSDF. The Coast Guard likewise plays a vital role, intercepting multiple attempts by merchant and refugee vessels to run the line."

  PRC_plaaf_on_high_alert: "PLAAF Combat Air Patrols"

  PRC_finish_what_mao_started_desc: "After 1949 a famous slogan vowed to “plant the flag of victory on Taiwan.” Yet by 1976, Chairman Mao did not see reunification. With today’s shifting world and no U.S. interference, the People’s Liberation Army will cross the Strait and liberate all China."

  PRC_final_offensive: "The Final Offensive"
  PRC_final_offensive_desc: "After protracted fighting, we have encircled the island’s last significant forces within the Taipei metro. Guerrillas linger in the mountains, but taking Taipei will end hostilities. The People’s Liberation Army will conclude the War of Liberation—begun June 26, 1946—and China will be fully unified."
  
  PRC_unite_people: "Unite the Masses"
  PRC_unite_people_desc: "Beyond rooting out hostile elements hidden among the people, we will mobilize the masses to actively conduct counter-espionage. At the same time, to demonstrate the advantages of socialism and build identification with the new order, we will launch extensive aid and reconstruction for Taiwan, offer preferential policies for local residents, and encourage prompt application for PRC ID documents.\n\nRemember the soldiers’ creed; love the people wherever you go.\n\nDefend the motherland and press ever forward—welcomed and supported by all the people!"

  PRC_eight_points: "Eight Points for Attention"
  PRC_eight_points_desc: "Speak politely; trade fairly; return what you borrow; compensate for damage; do not hit or abuse; do not harm crops; do not harass women; do not mistreat prisoners.\n\nIn this final campaign, our conduct must be exemplary.

  PRC_utilize_xinjiang_methods: "Apply the Xinjiang Governance Package"
  PRC_utilize_xinjiang_methods_desc: "To restore stability swiftly, some advocate replicating measures used in Xinjiang: deploying a large peacekeeping/CT presence, enforcing strict public-security controls, and curfews in hotspots. This proposal is backed mainly by hardliners, senior officers, and security chiefs."

  PRC_one_china_two_systems: "One Country, Two Systems"
  PRC_one_china_two_systems_desc: "Others favor the Hong Kong/Macau template—rapidly establishing ‘One Country, Two Systems’ for Taiwan, transferring authority to a newly elected local government while gradually withdrawing PLA and PAP units. This aligns with long-standing commitments and is supported by moderates, diplomats, and civil administrators."

  PRC_gradual_stabilization: "Gradual Stabilization"
  PRC_gradual_stabilization_desc: "Through sustained effort, stability has broadly returned. Residents are venturing out, commerce and transit are resuming. Lingering resentment may persist, but this outcome is a remarkable success."

  PRC_unify_the_bureacracy: "Unify the Bureaucracy"
  PRC_unify_the_bureacracy_desc: "Lasting prosperity requires a reliable civil service.

  PRC_expand_the_blacklist_system: "Expand the Blacklist Regime"
  PRC_expand_the_blacklist_system_desc: "Leveraging big data from the social-credit system, we will catalogue the untrustworthy: not only debt evaders and local thugs, but also hostile foreign operatives and online agitators. In time, the digital tide will enable a more honest, orderly society."

  PRC_peoples_social_credit: "National Civic Information System"
  PRC_peoples_social_credit_desc: "Social credit will underpin a healthy, ethical, and harmonious society while safeguarding personal data.

As global warming becomes a shared challenge for all nations and rising seas threaten to inundate cities like Shanghai and Tianjin, the state has begun moving toward greener, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly policies. Yet the road to a beautiful green future remains long and arduous. We must show the resolve to ‘cut off a festering limb to save the body,’ letting go of extensive, backward, high-energy-consuming industries that once drove growth, while pushing supply-side structural reform and environmental policy reform.

  PRC_taiwan_war_cat: "War in the Taiwan Strait"
  PRC_taiwan_war_cat_desc: "Seventy years have flashed by, yet our national map still bears a gap. When the People’s Liberation Army liberated all of China in 1949, the craven Kuomintang reactionaries fled to the island of Taiwan. The two twins—the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China—were separated by the Strait and developed apart. Over time, Western influence quietly seeped in, luring the people of Taiwan to forsake their roots and to craft a separate identity. But a tree without roots cannot live; division cannot last forever. Now, with the United States plunged into chaos, the coming war will decide whether we can fulfill our historic mission and bring a long-divided motherland back into one."

This is President Xi’s first overseas trip of the year, and the first visit by a Chinese head of state to Myanmar in 19 years. Coming in the 70th anniversary year of China–Myanmar diplomatic relations, the visit carries great significance for drawing on past experience and opening a future path for the relationship.\n\nPresident Xi will attend a series of state events hosted by President Win Myint, hold talks with State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and attend a ceremony for the exchange of bilateral cooperation agreements as well as a small banquet hosted by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The President will meet Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, communicate with members of the Myanmar parliament and party leaders, and participate in events including the celebration of the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the launch ceremony—co-hosted with Myanmar’s top leaders—of the China–Myanmar Year of Culture and Tourism.

  china.4.d: "Today, the collapse of international markets, triggered by soaring oil prices and the Saudi economy’s breakdown amid civil war, has dealt China a severe blow. The Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges hit historic lows, and leading economists predict that the situation will only worsen. In addition, the crash of the New York Stock Exchange and large-scale overseas economic turmoil have produced knock-on effects that are battering China’s economy, forcing millions of companies to turn to layoffs. It is clear that the fast ship of progress steered by the Communist Party over the past fifty years has slowed, and China’s economy appears to have stalled."

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission stated that 41 suspected cases of infection with a novel coronavirus are under hospital isolation, seven of whom are in critical condition. A total of 739 close contacts are under medical observation, up from the previous 163, including 419 involving medical personnel.\n\nTreatment after admission did not improve his condition, and the patient died of cardiac failure on the evening of January 9. Reports say his test for the virus returned positive.\n\nOfficial media on Thursday, citing scientists leading the investigation, reported that a preliminary inquiry has identified the respiratory illness as being caused by a novel coronavirus."
  china.5.a: "Let’s hope it doesn’t get worse."

  china.10.t: "Wuhan Outbreak Confirmed to Be Caused by a Coronavirus"
  china.10.d: "Our scientists have provided preliminary information on the Wuhan pneumonia cases—including the occupations, locations, and symptom profiles of those infected—all of which indicate that a coronavirus is likely the pathogen behind this cluster. Laboratory testing has ruled out SARS, MERS, influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, and other common respiratory pathogens.\n\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reports that the number of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, has risen from 27 on December 31 to 59 as of Sunday, seven of whom are in critical condition. No deaths have been reported yet."

  china.11.d: "Amid the flames of war in the Middle East, many of our citizens are facing a deeply worrying reality—empty tanks and broken dreams—while few can afford to fuel their many machines. Were this only a week-long incident in a small city or province, we might dismiss it as a coincidence and carry on as usual.\n\nBut these problems are not confined to a few small communities; they are appearing at transport hubs in major cities. Trains cannot obtain fuel, most trucks cannot move on the highways, and workers are finding it impossible to drive to their factories. If we, as a great nation, do not recover from this issue quickly, our status as the world’s ‘factory’ will face serious risks."
  china.11.a: "We must help the civilians!"
  
  china.12.t: "The Party’s Dual Nature"
  china.12.d: "Since Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms, the Chinese Communist Party has wrestled with a fundamental split in its policy outlook. On one side stands a camp that advocates focusing on restoring social equality and ensuring a fair distribution of economic resources. In contrast, the other camp argues for accelerating the accumulation of productive forces—expanding output and “making the economic pie bigger.”\n\nUnder Xi Jinping’s leadership, this internal dualism has grown more visible and more active. He has adroitly navigated between these competing ideologies, striving to satisfy both camps while preserving the delicate balance that sustains the People’s Republic’s intricate state architecture.\n\nObservers note that the Party may be approaching a pivotal moment when this ideological tug-of-war must be resolved clearly. The CCP will need to set national policy decisively; the time to end the current turbulence and division may be close at hand. That critical moment could require a clear choice between two divergent paths—reviving an old question: “Black cat or white cat?”"

  china.13.t: "Expanding Welfare"
  china.13.d: "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily decided to widen social-welfare coverage to meet the needs of the public. As time passes, however, we must consider whether these expanded welfare reforms should be made permanent."
  china.13.a: "These measures are only temporary."
  china.13.b: "Keep the reforms."

  china.15.t: "2022 CCP General Secretary Election"
  china.15.d: "The closely watched 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party has recently concluded in Beijing. Delegates from across the country are departing the capital, but the Great Hall of the People has not yet dimmed its crystal chandeliers. Only when the newly elected 20th Central Committee completes its first agenda—choosing the Party’s leadership—will this political ritual officially end.\n\nOn the day of the press conference, amid a barrage of camera flashes and shutter clicks, seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, including the General Secretary, walked the red carpet and presented themselves to the world. Although there had been intense speculation, seeing Xi Jinping selected in person for a third term as General Secretary still sent ripples across the globe. Foreign governments offered cautious congratulations and, with no small amount of concern, awaited the next steps of the hardline leader who has broken with unwritten norms to serve a third term."
  china.15.a: "China’s critical moment is approaching."

  china.17.t: "Hu Chunhua Aligns with the New Left"
  china.17.d: "Breaking with convention, Vice Premier Hu Chunhua appears to have joined the New Left. In a series of interviews with CCTV’s CGTN, Hu endorsed several populist policies and condemned wealth inequality—signaling a sharp leftward shift in his politics.\n\nSince the arrest of Bo Xilai, the New Left has lacked a central figure; Hu now seems prepared to play that role. Many consider him less radical than Bo, but there is little doubt that the post-Xi Hu Chunhua will differ markedly from the Hu Chunhua we knew before.\n\nAs an emergent liberal faction inside the CCP strives to consolidate power, the left-wing conservatives have not yielded. With China poised between liberalism and socialism, her future is more uncertain than ever."
  china.17.a: "The Left rises again."

  china.18.t: "Hu Chunhua Elected General Secretary"
  china.18.d: "Following Xi Jinping’s downfall, former Vice Premier Hu Chunhua has assumed the post of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Compared with his predecessor, Hu appears to have adopted a more populist stance, pledging to deepen China’s reforms while steadfastly upholding socialist ideals. In a recent appearance on state television, he made clear that his alignment with the New Left will mean rolling back many market-based policies while seeking to bridge the yawning wealth gap that has opened over the past fifty years. As China revisits elements of earlier systems, the future remains uncertain—but the public is, nonetheless, cautiously optimistic."
  china.18.a: "Chairman Mao can smile in his grave."

  china.19.t: "Wang Yang Elected General Secretary"
  china.19.d: "After Xi Jinping’s fall, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Wang Yang, became General Secretary of the CCP. Since stepping into the national spotlight as Guangdong’s Party Secretary, Wang has been viewed as a reformer. His support for free-market policies and for NGOs has made him popular among liberals. General Secretary Wang has announced that under his leadership China will pursue a path combining market-oriented reform with political reform. At home, there is broad optimism about a future-focused vision for China."
  china.19.a: "A future of freedom."

  china.20.t: "Xi Jinping Consolidates Power"
  china.20.d: "After an emergency Politburo meeting, the 19th Politburo decided—through a constitutional amendment—to enshrine Xi Jinping Thought as the official state ideology. In legal terms, this fundamentally cements Xi’s position as China’s undisputed leader. While liberal reformers and left-wing conservatives still exist within the Party, they now serve primarily as Xi’s advisers. Though the move has been denounced in the West as authoritarian, many Chinese regard it as the best way to pursue the Chinese Dream: a prosperous nation ready to assume global leadership. China is setting sail toward the future, with Xi as the third great helmsman."
  china.20.a: "As expected."

  china.21.t: "Li Zuocheng Elected General Secretary"
  china.21.d: "Following Xi Jinping’s downfall, General Li Zuocheng, former Chief of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, has become General Secretary of the CCP. For the first time since the Mao era, China is led by a general rather than a Party cadre. This extraordinary elevation signals the People’s Liberation Army’s increasingly prominent role in Chinese politics. In a rousing speech broadcast on CGTN, Li vowed to restore China’s standing in the world and to right historical wrongs. As the PLA begins to mobilize, many eyes turn nervously to Taiwan, for a nationalist China will undoubtedly seek to end the civil war once and for all."
  china.21.a: "China will prosper."

  china.22.t: "Chen Wenqing Elected General Secretary"
  china.22.d: "After Xi Jinping’s fall, former Minister of State Security Chen Wenqing assumed the post of General Secretary of the CCP. In a nationwide address, he spoke of his long-standing concern about “the plague that has infected the motherland,” brought by enemy agents and spies, and pledged to continue safeguarding China and its citizens. Under Chen’s leadership, China has massively expanded its citizen-surveillance programs. Many fear the Party is moving in an ever more authoritarian direction, seemingly intent on controlling every aspect of public life."
  china.22.a: "China’s prospects are bleak."

  china.6.t: "Blockade of Taiwan"
  china.6.d: "Today the People’s Republic of China undertook an unprecedented and overtly aggressive action, using its naval forces to impose a comprehensive blockade of Taiwan and encircle the island in layers. Not only territorial waters but the airspace above has been sealed tight, preventing any civilians or officials from escaping. Panic has swept Taiwan, and a severe economic crisis is unfolding as trade lanes are cut and commerce is strangled.\n\nThe international community—especially Western countries—has broadly condemned China’s action, calling for an immediate end to the blockade and urging Beijing to de-escalate. Taiwan’s allies, led by Japan and Australia, have voiced strong support for Taipei, stressing the necessity of upholding international law amid worldwide turmoil and pledging direct assistance should the situation continue to escalate. The effectiveness of these responses, however, is blunted by the United States’ internal divisions; Washington is mired in its own conflict and cannot render the help it otherwise might.\n\nWith the prospect of military confrontation drawing nearer, Taiwan’s situation grows ever more precarious. The absence of U.S. backing—combined with rising tensions and China’s economic coercion—casts a pall over Taiwan’s future and drags its allies into a frighteningly uncertain predicament."
  china.6.a: "Tensions in Asia intensify…"

  china.7.t: "The PRC Continues the Liberation War"
  china.7.d: "What historians are calling the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis has now escalated into a full-scale war between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China for control of Taiwan, reigniting the civil war that had lain dormant since the Nationalists fled to the island. Hundreds of jet fighters duel overhead while the PLA Navy stands at full mobilization; reports indicate fierce firefights at landing sites around Taiwan and the Matsu Islands. The ROC has announced a general mobilization, and martial law has been declared across Taiwan. The Coast Guard reports PLA landing ships transiting the Strait toward the island. The ROC’s most die-hard holdouts will, at last, be crushed under the onslaught of the People’s Liberation Army."
  china.7.a: "The final showdown."

  china.8.t: "The PRC Seizes Kinmen Island"
  china.8.d: "The People’s Liberation Army has executed multi-point amphibious landings across the Kinmen archipelago, marking the first return to open hostility between the mainland and Taiwan in roughly sixty years. Situated only eight kilometers from the mainland, the Kinmen Islands had long been administered by the ROC and remained a persistent flashpoint in cross-strait relations. At dawn, PLA paratroopers and Marines seized strategic positions across the islands, rapidly overwhelming the ROC garrison. Taipei has denounced this as a “grave violation of the Republic of China’s sovereignty.” Though neither side has formally declared war, the region’s geopolitical landscape has shifted in an unprecedented way."
  china.8.a: "Further escalation in the Strait."

  china.9.t: "Reflections on the Kinmen Operation"
  china.9.d: "Kinmen has been wrested from the grip of the Taiwan authorities and returned to the embrace of the motherland. At an appropriate time, local administration will be transferred to Quanzhou City in Fujian Province.\n\nRaising the August First (八一) banner over Kinmen is a victory long deferred—the shame of the 1949 Battle of Kinmen has finally been washed away. Yet this is no reason for the PLA to relax. The Eastern Theater Command has decided to convene a high-level conference to review all the shortcomings revealed during the operation. Commanders concurred that years without war inevitably bred a “peace disease”: orders from higher echelons were sometimes distorted in transmission, and units occasionally deviated from operational intent when executing those orders. Casualty reports further show that a significant share of losses stemmed from malfunctions in various new weapons systems—evidence that seemingly powerful equipment still must be proven against battlefield contingencies.\n\nTo prevent similar errors in the campaigns to come, the Theater Command will submit the minutes to the Central Military Commission with a recommendation for PLA-wide study. The precious lessons purchased with our comrades’ sacrifices must spare others from needless loss—and save many brothers-in-arms."
  china.9.a: "We are a step closer to reunification—learn the lessons well."

  china.23.t: "China Reclaims Taiwan"
  china.23.d: "Across East Asia in the twenty-first century, a regional conflict that held the world’s attention has at last drawn to a close after fierce confrontations and brutal fighting.\n\nFrom the outset, the war commanded global focus. To many strategists and ordinary people alike, the outcome felt foreordained—like dawn inevitably following night—an expectation grounded in the balance of power and the direction of the tide.\n\nEven so, when that presumed outcome hardened into iron fact before the eyes of the world, people were profoundly shaken.\n\nChina’s Ministry of National Defense has formally announced the war’s final result: after multiple rounds of intense combat, Taiwan’s armed forces have been completely annihilated. With its military defeated, the island’s remnant authorities lost their last pillar of support and were forced to surrender unconditionally.\n\nThe Pacific Defense Front, which had vigorously backed Taiwan, has been left to swallow the bitter fruit of its own making. Despite pouring in manpower, materiel, and money, it failed to alter the verdict of defeat in Taiwan and suffered severe losses itself; its influence on the international stage has markedly declined.\n\nInside China, jubilation has erupted from coast to coast. For the first time since 1895, the country has achieved national unification—an event of immense historical significance for both state and people.\n\nStreets and alleys blaze with lanterns and banners; people sing and dance to mark this great moment. President Xi Jinping is preparing to deliver a historic address to the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, capitals around the world have sent congratulatory messages—saluting China’s victory and acknowledging its efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability.\n\nAs the U.S.-constructed East Asian order crumbles, China’s triumph in this conflict has unquestionably strengthened its hand for the coming strategic contest with Japan. In the eyes of many analysts, China has seized the initiative in an approaching Sino-Japanese Cold War."
  china.23.a: "A sweeping victory for the Republic."

  china.24.t: "China Defeated in the Taiwan Strait"
  china.24.d: "Cheering echoes across Taiwan as the People’s Republic of China today announced an end to its military operations against the island. After weeks of bitter fighting, the PLA never secured a firm foothold and was repeatedly thrown back by Taiwan’s defenders.\n\nWith the invasion repulsed, Taiwan’s politicians have turned to questions of reconstruction and international recognition. Lawmakers debate whether to maintain the “Republic of China” or sever the name’s historical ties and adopt “Republic of Taiwan.” Meanwhile, the people of Taiwan can finally sleep in peace, knowing that the whims of Beijing’s leaders no longer determine their fate."
  china.24.a: "The dragon’s wings are broken."

  china.31.t: "COVID-19 Spreads to Other Provinces!"
  china.31.d: "Bad news is arriving one wave after another. Reports of COVID-19 ravaging all of Hubei have piled high on the health commission director’s desk. Now suspected cases are being reported in neighboring provinces such as Hunan and Sichuan, in the economic hubs of Shanghai and Guangdong, and even in the political capital, Beijing. It is no longer realistic to contain the outbreak within a single province. We must swiftly adjust strategy, begin mobilizing the entire nation to face the pandemic, and do so while averting public panic. May it not be too late."
  china.31.a: "We need to get this under control!"

  china.34.t: "COVID-19 Reaches Overseas!"
  china.34.desc: "Despite strenuous efforts by both central and local governments, the coronavirus continues to spread. From nearby South Korea and Japan to Italy and France in Europe, and even across the Pacific in the United States, suspected cases are being reported. Because most cases abroad involve Chinese tourists or people who recently traveled to China, many governments have announced suspensions of transport links with China—restrictions that may take quite some time to lift."
  china.34.a: "This is turning into an international crisis!"

  china.35.t: "Trade Agreement with Russia Concluded!"
  china.35.d: "As international tensions rise, we must look beyond the United States, Europe, and Japan for more reliable trading partners to ensure our economy is not devastated by political clashes or trade disputes. It is time to deepen economic cooperation with our traditional political partner—the Russian Federation. Russian oil, natural gas, and minerals flow along transport arteries to China, while Chinese light-industrial goods and high-tech products travel in the other direction. Glasses of vodka and Moutai clink again and again, symbolizing an ever-closer trade relationship between two countries standing together against Western hegemony."
  china.35.a: "A toast to our comrades in the north!"
  
  china.36.t: "Cross-Strait Reunification"
  china.36.d: "Seventy years after kin were torn apart, and after nationwide effort and the PLA’s valor in battle, Taiwan and the mainland have at last been reunited under the flag of the People’s Republic of China. After the Chinese Communist Party liberated the mainland in 1949, the Kuomintang’s remnant regime retreated to Taiwan, biding its time for a “counteroffensive” against the mainland. The ROC dream persisted on Taiwan for seven decades, under constant pressure from pro-independence forces and from the PRC—until now, when it has collapsed. The Taipei authorities have formally declared that the Republic of China government no longer exists, with all administrative functions transferred to a military government. The PRC has pledged that, before 2049, Taiwan will implement a high degree of autonomy similar to the Hong Kong–Macao model; for now, however, the island remains under military administration."
  china.36.a: "At last, the civil war is over."

  china.37.t: "PLA Coup!"
  china.37.d: "For the first time in over thirty years, Beijing has fallen still. Tanks have rumbled across Tiananmen Square, heading for Zhongnanhai, the Great Hall of the People, and other seats of government. Under the previous leadership, popular discontent surged, society grew turbulent, and the international situation deteriorated. General Li Zuocheng has now announced:\n\n“ For the security of the state and the honor of the people, the army must temporarily assume control to restore national order.”\n\nRumors from Beijing speak of a purge of key civilian officials in the former government, though the new military authorities have not confirmed this. International observers watch anxiously to see how the rest of China will respond, as the country appears more unstable than at any time since the Cultural Revolution."
  china.37.a: "Long live!"

  china.38.a: "Echoes of June Fourth…"

  china.39.t: "Tibet in Peril"
  china.39.d: "China’s increasingly unsettled situation seems to have emboldened traitors who plot to dismember our territory. The Tibet Autonomous Region—a highland realm that has seen no major incident for nearly twenty years—has now been seized by fear and unease. Hate speech spread by separatists and the deliberate stoking of Han–Tibetan ethnic conflict have pushed local society to the brink. The regional government is struggling to keep transport and the economy functioning, and Beijing has ordered most areas of Tibet under martial law, with additional security forces dispatched from neighboring, more stable provinces."
  china.39.a: "Let’s hope they arrive in time…!"

  china.40.d: "Tibet has long been a contentious topic in China’s geopolitics. Since its reintegration into the PRC in 1951, the region has wrestled with separatist activity and the agitation of Tibetan independence groups in exile. Yet in more than seventy years, the situation has never been as turbulent as it is now. The social crisis triggered by defeat in the Taiwan Strait has paralyzed grassroots administration, previously suppressed separatists have reemerged, and public fear of growing instability is accelerating the deterioration. Beijing has announced a state of emergency and imposed martial law in parts of Tibet. The international community looks with deep concern upon this high plateau fallen into silence."
  china.40.a: "Will the white snow mountains be stained red with blood?"

  china.41.t: "Order Collapses in Xinjiang"
  china.41.d: "Chaos has erupted in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. The local government has lost control of the countryside, allowing Islamist militias to seize these areas. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement—our foe for over thirty years—has launched a full-scale jihad against local administrations at every level. In the north, radical Kazakh insurgents have sparked their own pan-Islamic revolt; in central Xinjiang, an even more extreme ETIM offshoot is indiscriminately massacring Han civilians. Urumqi has descended into ethnic rioting, with Han and Uyghur communities at each other’s throats—scenes of bloodshed that make the unrest of 2008 seem like a schoolyard scuffle by comparison…"
  china.41.a: "#Fuck your mother, Uyghurs"

  china.42.d: "Anyone who believed that Xinjiang would be forever prosperous and peaceful after an iron-fisted campaign was gravely mistaken. In less than a decade the region has again sunk into conflict and street violence. Uyghurs have taken to the streets, wielding kitchen knives, steel forks, and whatever tools are at hand to confront the police, while ransacking and burning Han homes and shops. As the crisis deepens, once-quiescent extremist groups are active again, and some street fighters now brandish assault rifles.\n\nThe East Turkestan Islamic Movement—an extremist group that has staged cross-border attacks from the Afghan frontier—has proclaimed its intent to “liberate our Muslim brothers and sisters in East Turkestan.” Zhongnanhai, for its part, denounces ETIM as radical jihadists and calls upon the Muslim world to join in opposing fundamentalism."
  china.42.a: "The nightmares of 2009 and 2011 are repeating…"

  china.43.t: "Rise of the Red Dragon"
  china.43.d: "Measured against the achievements of forty years of reform and opening, almost everything else seems small. Through the struggle of generations, we can finally say with pride: “The Chinese people cannot be defeated!” Under Deng Xiaoping, China adopted a pragmatic course—what the world knows as socialism with Chinese characteristics. State-owned enterprises were privatized, and a new era of economic growth began. Under Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, China pursued a path of peaceful rise through commerce and globalization. Politically, successive leaders adhered to the strategy of “keeping a low profile,” creating conditions for development with the ultimate aim of making a greater contribution.\n\nThat changed in 2013, when the First Session of the 12th National People’s Congress convened in Beijing and, by secret ballot, elected Xi Jinping President of the People’s Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As Xi became the CCP’s new core, policy began to shift. Confronted with an increasingly aggressive U.S. strategy of containment, Xi proved less inclined than his predecessors to hide China’s light, taking a firmer stance to show the world that the era of “keeping a low profile” had ended. China’s image as a responsible major power—emphasizing “peace,” “anti-hegemony,” and “win-win cooperation”—stands in contrast to America’s habitual hegemonism. Even so, global views of China are mixed, which is understandable: China has always stood outside the Western world—we will be neither anyone’s loyal hound nor a hegemon’s echo. China will stand tall as a champion of independence, sovereignty, fairness, and justice.\n\nNow, with the Year of the Rat upon us, the PRC faces changes unseen in a century. The United States is both arch-rival and profitable trading partner. Should it one day topple, China—under the Party Center’s steadfast leadership—will still work with all peace-loving nations to address global challenges and strive for a brighter future for humanity. Though Moscow, New Delhi, and Brussels remain potential competitors for Beijing, the present moment holds both peril and boundless opportunity."

When the Northeast fell into anarchy, large numbers of PLA soldiers broke from central command and the Beijing government, degenerating into bandits and warlords. From their ranks emerged Guo Daiyu, an ambitious young soldier. Through cunning and ties with the Russian mercenaries flooding into the Northeast, he rose swiftly. These private contractors, euphemistically, claimed to be “helping freedom fighters in China’s darkest hour.”\n\nFrom mere regional strongmen, the mercenaries gradually broadened their ambitions to the unification of China. They professed no ideology, ruling by brute methods while corruption ran rampant at every level. Soon after unifying the country, Guo simply named the new state “China,” receiving recognition from Russia and Iran, though most Western nations withheld recognition. Rumors speak of dissent simmering in the lower ranks; only time will tell how long Guo will hold his newly won throne."

With the collapse of the Northeast, China’s notorious secret police, the MSS, established a ministate on the northern plain as the PLA failed to rein in anarchists and mercenaries. As their control solidified, Minister Chen Wenqing’s ambitions grew: the MSS and its forces marched on Beijing, seeking to seize the machinery of state and impose their iron rule on the rest of the country.\n\nArguing that China’s greatest threat is internal fragmentation and that Beijing had done too little to curb anti-state revolt, they instituted draconian social and economic regimes, attempting to place every facet of life under Party control. Though the formal names of the CCP and the PRC remain, it is clear the country has undergone a fundamental transformation, and China’s future is deeply uncertain."
  china.54.a: "Too Orwellian."

  china.55.a: "Too Orwellian."

  china.56.d: "After a bitter struggle, the flower of freedom has begun to bloom in China. Cao Yuanjun, a young farmer from Liaoning, captured a generation’s imagination with charismatic speeches and rose step by step through local government. When anarchy swept the region, she ultimately led a movement resisting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the wake of the economic shocks from the oil crisis and the U.S. civil war—and the central government’s feckless response—Cao rode the voices of Tieling’s farmers to victory in local elections, and her agriculture-centered development model quickly spread across Liaoning.\n\nFacing intensifying repression from the MSS faction and impossible production quotas, Cao and her many loyal followers launched a guerrilla war in the Northeast—one that eventually swept the nation and thrust the young Cao into the international spotlight. Many observers abroad remain skeptical of this youthful government, questioning how an inexperienced Cao will confront mounting reconstruction challenges. Many of her promised agricultural reforms and wealth-redistribution programs have yet to deliver on their initial pledges, raising fears of alienating her base.\n\nEven so, the new government criticizes the United Front governance model that dominated Beijing for the past seventy years as too constricting and has permitted the formation of opposition parties. Although press censorship and repression persist, many still hope the Cao administration can transform China into a modern democracy."

Through a stringent campaign to reestablish local order, China has emerged from the conflict. Though crime and disorder remain common sights on city streets, the scars of war make it unlikely that things will simply return to normal.\n\nWith separatist and anti-Party movements rampant, the CCP has doubled down on chauvinism. Shortly after Xi delivered a televised address from Beijing, nationwide trials of insurgents began, and martial law was imposed in every province until further notice.\n\nOn the international stage, China has suffered profound humiliation. Western nations refuse to recognize the CCP government, preferring instead to maintain recognition of the Republic of China. Other countries have cautiously restored relations in hopes of extracting benefits from the new regime. With the economy in ruins and infrastructure damage amounting to tens of billions, China’s global standing has plummeted. It appears the CCP’s appetite for power will be on hold for years to come."

China’s economy has nearly ground to a halt overnight, with billions in exports unable to reach consumers, and Beijing is under immense pressure to respond.\n\nChina answered almost immediately, announcing countermeasures against Pact members as social media filled with anxiety over global price spikes. Militarily, the PLAN has fully mobilized; multiple battle groups have met Pact fleets in the Strait, creating a taut maritime standoff. No shots have been fired so far, but both sides are mobilizing in earnest, and many fear this Asian crisis could spin out of control.\n\nNeither side has yet broached negotiations, further ratcheting up tensions as capitals brace for this brittle confrontation to tip into open war. The cold-war-style standoff continues to escalate."
  china.59.a: "War clouds gather over Asia…"
  
  china.60.d: "War and bloodshed shroud the land of China, as an unprecedented cataclysm sweeps this ancient country. The National Collective Movement has now cemented its iron rule over China. Driven by an extremist ideology and a perverse view of humanity, this totalitarian organization seeks to erase the individual from existence. Their unfeeling soldiers, faces blank, trample every voice of resistance. On their quest for unification, countless cities have been reduced to ash, rebellious villages wiped from the map, and once-vibrant cultural capitals now lie as nothing but sprawling mass graves.\n\nStories from refugees and survivors sketch a chilling tableau: in that land, families, friends—indeed even names—are forcibly stripped away. The meaning of personal existence has been reduced to a single goal—to live for the state. Their official doctrine, the “Theory of Self-Extinction,” is a brutal distortion of Buddhist teachings: all personal desires must be annihilated, and only absolute obedience can realize this “collective body.” Their aim is to stifle progress and turn back the clock—halt history here and freeze time in an unchanging eternity.\n\nChina’s internal anarchy has unleashed one of the worst refugee crises and humanitarian disasters in human history. The world can only watch in terror and helplessness as the regime now styling itself the “Celestial Empire” strides onto the world stage and casts its greedy gaze in all directions. In a shockingly theatrical television address, a masked spokesman for a leader known as the “Heavenly Father” proclaimed the National Collective Movement the rightful ruler of all Asia, declaring: “Any attempt to resist the people’s newborn collective unity will face the total fury of a billion unified wills.”"

  china.62.d: "It is as if China’s clock has been turned back to 1960, as the Red Army reunifies a shattered nation. The Maoist Communist Party of China was founded in 2008 by disaffected urban workers and rural peasants who condemned the post-Deng reforms as “capitalist-roadism” and sought to overthrow the “treacherous revisionist ruling clique” to restore communism. In fact, because of his activities, their leader Ma Houzhi was arrested in 2008 and was not released until 2019.\n\nShortly after his release, he and a circle of disciples fled to the mountains of Shanxi—the cradle of the first revolution—where they began to assemble and train cadres for a protracted people’s war. Thus, when anarchy descended on China, the Red Army rapidly expanded its influence, winning the support of those left behind by the reform era.\n\nIn the cities, democratic dissidents watched in horror as scenes reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution reappeared: “symbols of modern Western decadence” were smashed en masse; renowned university professors were dismissed and publicly harassed. Now revolutionary fervor has dyed China crimson once more, and chaos has swept the land."

  china.68.d: "With Hong Kong police driven from the city by pro-independence protesters and armed militants, disturbing reports have emerged that the Hong Kong government has fled to Shenzhen and that a PLA task force is currently on standby there. As the cross-strait “war for unification” intensifies, Hong Kong’s streets have plunged into turmoil, with criminals and mobs taking advantage to burn, loot, and even kill. The provisional pro-democracy government’s forces are trying to stem the chaos, and thus the protesters’ original petitions have largely been ignored. Student-formed militias are preparing to defend every street of Hong Kong to the last person; it is almost certain the city cannot be retaken without significant loss of life."
  china.68.a: "Take down those Western lapdogs!"

  china.69.t: "The Hong Kong Revolution"
  china.69.d: "Since the outbreak of the Taiwan Strait war, Hong Kong’s already dire economy has further deteriorated under the twin blows of COVID-19 and economic blockade, while public discontent with the government has reached historic highs. As weeks of demonstrations evolved into open confrontation between protest groups and the authorities, protester forces—led primarily by radical university students—seized control of multiple police stations and key districts. Pro-independence activist Jimmy Lai announced the establishment of a Hong Kong Provisional Government inside the occupied Legislative Council building, claiming it represents “the true will of the people of Hong Kong,” and calling for international recognition. Although the provisional government controls most of Hong Kong and has even pushed into SAR-held areas such as Lok Ma Chau and Sheung Shui, Beijing clearly will not ignore the situation."
  china.69.a: "Five demands, not one less!"

  china.70.t: "Foreign Spies Spread Anti-War Propaganda"
  china.70.d: "It appears that foreign agents have circulated numerous rumors about the war over Taiwan, claiming the government is underreporting PLA casualties while inflating the war’s economic costs. In addition, photos purportedly taken by doctors have surfaced online, alleging to show evidence of PRC war crimes on the island. Thanks to the hard work of censors and moderators, these reactionary accounts have been banned, but they will almost certainly reappear. Unfortunately, many of the images have already resonated with the general public and lower-level Party members, which means the pace of the war must be accelerated before they begin to protest."

  china.71.t: "Islamist Terrorists Launch Attacks"
  china.71.d: "With the outbreak of the National Unification War, Islamist extremist groups such as the East Turkestan Liberation Organization have managed to regroup and reorganize, launching attacks on civilian infrastructure across Xinjiang. Although Chen Quanguo, Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, assured the Politburo that the terrorist threat would be eliminated, no tangible progress has been made so far."
  china.71.a: "What a disaster."

  china.72.t: "The PLA Liberates Taipei"
  china.72.d: "Xinhua reports: Under the irresistible onslaught of the People’s Liberation Army, although “Taiwan independence” secessionist forces tried to send reinforcements into Taipei via treacherous mountain roads in the southeast, the combined naval–air supporting fires of the PLA shattered organically formed units of the puppet troops; many were routed or wiped out, forcing them to abandon any attempt at direct confrontation with our forces.\n\nThe PLA has successfully liberated Taipei, achieving its primary objective of striking at the separatist camp. While our forces have done their utmost to minimize damage to the property of our Taiwan compatriots without jeopardizing the overall operation, the “Taiwan independence” secessionists and militarist intervenors of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization brazenly used civilian property as shields in their last-ditch resistance, leading to significant losses for many compatriots. Several hundred Japanese and Australian interventionist troops were captured in battle; more were eliminated by our forces.\n\nWith Taipei liberated, the PLA stands just one step away from the goal of eradicating the secessionist threat. All units that took part in the Battle of Taipei will continue to act according to plan, preparing to annihilate the separatists and interventionists entrenched in the central mountains—now completely cut off from the outside world.\n\nGeneral Lin Xiangyang, Commander of the PLA Eastern Theater Command, stated that the military operation to achieve national reunification is proceeding as planned and that all separatist strongholds will be destroyed within the coming month. He concluded by warning the militarist intervenors of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization that their support for “Taiwan independence” is nothing but a reckless act of playing with fire."
  china.72.a: "The tide of reunification cannot be stopped."

  china.73.t: "Student Anti-War Demonstrations"
  china.73.d: "As the war over Taiwan drags on, dissatisfaction has grown across society—especially within academia and intellectual circles. University students and professors around the country have stepped forward to oppose the war, calling it a violation of human rights. Although these protests may have little direct impact on government policy, they reveal that the public increasingly opposes rising PLA casualties in a conflict that offers no immediate, tangible benefits. Officials from the Ministry of State Security recommend taking action now to crush these protests before their subversive messaging spreads. Meanwhile, reformers within the government urge allowing the demonstrations to proceed while condemning the protesters in the media as puppets of foreign forces, thereby showcasing China’s commitment to freedom of expression."

At Huoshenshan Hospital, President Xi spoke via video link with a patient, saying: “What you need to do now is keep faith. We should all have confidence—we will win this war. Wuhan will prevail, Hubei will prevail, and China will prevail!”\n\nCalling the outbreak the most rapid-spreading, widest-ranging, and hardest-to-contain public health emergency since the founding of the PRC, Xi emphasized that “life comes first.” Meeting with local cadres, he announced the launch of a “people’s war,” assuming personal command to marshal national resources against this “invisible enemy.”"

  china.75.d: "This Saturday, people across China halted their activities and observed three minutes of silence. In public spaces throughout the major cities, masked residents gathered at a distance, bowing their heads to honor the thousands of compatriots—friends, family, patients, and medical workers—who lost their lives.\n\nAir-raid sirens and car horns sounded in unison to express the nation’s grief. Dressed in black, President Xi led the top Communist Party leadership in a moment of silence at a ceremony in Beijing. Flags were flown at half-mast nationwide, and entertainment activities were suspended. State media outlets such as Xinhua and China Daily switched their homepages to black-and-white for the day. Many social media users also changed their profiles to monochrome.\n\nThe National Day of Mourning coincided with the Qingming Festival, the traditional Chinese day for paying respects to ancestors. It is not the first time Qingming has been used to commemorate a specific tragedy; in earlier years, the festival has also served to mourn victims of earthquakes and other disasters."

  china.76.t: "Giant Pandas Are No Longer Endangered"

Cui Shuhong, an official with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, stated that the panda’s status has been updated to “Vulnerable.” The wild population has reached 1,800 individuals, a success credited to China’s sustained creation and protection of nature reserves and other conservation measures in recent years. Reports indicate that other species have benefited as well: populations of Amur tigers, Asian elephants, and crested ibises are all gradually increasing."

  china.77.t: "Japanese Forces Prepare to Invade Kinmen"
  china.77.d: "Today, the Ministry of State Security briefed us on an alarming development: Japan and its allies are planning an invasion of Kinmen. While the island might seem insignificant to casual observers, its strategic value is undeniable. Kinmen lies just off the coast of the Chinese mainland, and if seized by a hostile force, it would quickly become a severe liability.\n\nThe danger stems from its proximity to major cities vital to our forces operating in Taiwan. Should Kinmen fall, our cities and supply lines would be exposed to bombardment, becoming prime targets for enemy strikes—an outcome that would inevitably lead to serious setbacks.\n\nGiven these urgent concerns, we must immediately begin defensive preparations to counter the potential threat. Failure to act could carry grave consequences."
  china.77.a: "Mobilize the Coast Guard."

  china.78.t: "Kinmen Has Fallen!"
  china.78.d: "This morning we received reports that Japanese and Pacific Defense Treaty forces have formally seized the entire Kinmen archipelago. Despite our efforts to strengthen the island’s fortifications and mobilize an effective defense, we were unable to repel the maritime invasion.\n\nAfter days of fierce fighting, our troops fought bravely, but mounting enemy pressure forced our soldiers to withdraw to the mainland. Soon afterward, we received word that the enemy has begun shelling all ports near the islands."
  china.78.a: "Utterly disgraceful!"

  china.79.t: "Kinmen Holds!"
  china.79.d: "This morning we received reports that Japanese and PDTO forces have been successfully repelled from the Kinmen archipelago. It appears our efforts to reinforce the island’s defenses have paid off.\n\nAfter days of brutal jungle fighting and urban combat, our troops fought with high morale and great courage—and it showed. The enemy was unprepared for a war of attrition and soon ordered a full withdrawal."
  china.79.a: "We taught them a proper lesson."

  china.80.t: "EADI–PDTO Cold War Begins"
  china.80.d: "TASS reports that Sino-Japanese tensions are at a breaking point, with the shadow of a new Cold War hanging over Asia.\n\nFor years, China and Japan have sparred over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Recently, the formation of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization (PDTO) and China’s operation to recover Taiwan have sharply intensified the situation, stoking widespread fears of war. From the end of the Taiwan Strait War onward, both sides have dramatically increased military spending. The PDTO—established on the eve of that war—has been seen in Beijing as a provocative move by Japan to obstruct China’s reunification and interfere in China’s internal affairs. In the aftermath of the Second American Civil War, China created the East Asian Defense Initiative (EADI) to counter the threat posed by Japan’s PDTO.\n\nToday the situation remains tense and unpredictable. Both sides continue provocative maneuvers and exchange inflammatory rhetoric. Tokyo demands “substantive concessions” from Beijing, while China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declares that China will “neither retreat nor kneel,” adding that no one understands better than China the consequences of bowing to imperialist powers. The world watches as the war clouds that refuse to lift gather over Asia’s two great rivals."

The pre-dawn salvos plunged the island into chaos, with explosions reported in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and other major cities. Authorities on the island urged residents to remain calm as emergency services scrambled to contain the damage. Initial reports indicate heavy hits on military installations and air defenses—signaling Beijing’s intent to degrade Taiwan’s ability to respond quickly. This unprecedented barrage marks the mainland’s most direct military action against Taiwan in years, pushing the fragile status quo to the brink of collapse.\n\nJapanese officials voiced deep concern, warning that the conflict could spill over and destabilize the wider region. Tokyo called for restraint and cautioned that any turmoil would have far-reaching consequences for East Asia. With diplomatic channels unclear, Taiwan’s armed forces are mobilizing under overwhelming firepower, acutely aware that how they react in these crucial hours may decide the island’s fate."

  china.84.t: "Choosing the Path Forward"
  china.84.d: "The first 24 hours of the Taiwan Strait War are over, and we can only congratulate the brave People’s Liberation Army. The puppet forces of the Taiwan authorities are in disarray. Early-warning radars and SAM vehicles that formed their first defensive line were hunted down by J-20s before they could even activate. Thousands of fighters were destroyed on their runways by the Rocket Force. Taiwan’s antiquated warships now burn in harbor, belching thick black smoke. Our satellites track every movement of Taiwan’s much weaker armored units in real time.\n\nPLA commanders are debating the next step. Frontline officers in the Eastern Theater argue we must exploit the narrow window created by surprise: dispatch the landing fleets immediately and establish beachheads before the enemy recovers from its losses. Planners at the Joint Staff Department, however, warn that main PDTO elements are entering the fight; we must not act rashly and should spend the coming days suppressing any potential counterattack.\n\nThe Central Military Commission has submitted both proposals to the Politburo for a final decision—a choice that could alter the entire course of the war."

  china.85.t: "Protests Erupt in Southern Cities"
  china.85.d: "Shenzhen—the once-proud window of reform and opening—now lies under a pall. Tens of thousands sit-in at the gates of the municipal Party committee compound and along Shennan Middle Road. They hold aloft placards daubed in red paint: “Down with the Communist Party,” “Give us back our jobs,” and “Death to Xi Jinping.” In the flowerbeds, the bronze ox statue—once a symbol of serving the people—has become a lightning rod for anger. Its base, horns, and back are scrawled with dense graffiti, every stroke dripping with despair and rage.\n\nShanghai, under the gaze of the Oriental Pearl, watches its people struggle in a forest of steel. From Nanjing Road’s pedestrian mall to Lujiazui’s financial district, from the bustle around Jing’an Temple to the People’s Square, protesters fill the streets. They chant for freedom of speech, for political reform, for Xi’s resignation. Some attempt to push through the cordons around the municipal government; flames flicker as the wave of protest swells.\n\nIn Changsha, two bunk beds take up most of a cramped dorm room at Central South University; quilts lie in a heap on the upper frames. In a corner, a laptop glows pale blue, looping Weibo and Douyin clips. Four young people stare at the screen: an ocean of heads, banners rolling like waves, slogans thundering. From Nanning to Haikou, from Fuzhou to Nanjing, the great cities of southern China are swept by a sudden tempest of protest. At last, one breaks the silence and says softly:"

  china.89.d: "Although Vietnam and China are both socialist states and, in theory, should be “in the same boat,” relations between the two have been delicate for most of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Deep-seated mistrust stems from centuries of Chinese domination and a series of wars—including the Song–Vietnam War, the Ming conquest, and the 1979 border war. In Vietnam, public opinion toward China is polarized: on one hand, many enjoy the tangible benefits of an economic system similar to China’s, welcome Chinese capital and tourists, and favor inexpensive Chinese electronics; on the other, Chinese incursions along the border—especially fishing disputes in the South China Sea—have bred considerable resentment among Chinese toward Vietnam. Now, with the world in flux, Hanoi and Beijing have chosen to affirm their socialist bonds through mutual cooperation within the EADI. Vietnam has broken with decades of neutrality and chosen a side in the coming conflict."

  china.90.t: "Vietnam Joins the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization"
  china.90.d: "Although Vietnam and China are both socialist states and, in theory, should be “in the same boat,” relations between them have been delicate throughout much of the 20th and 21st centuries. Deep-rooted mistrust stems from centuries of Chinese domination and multiple wars, including the Song–Vietnam War, the Ming conquest, and the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese border conflict. Public opinion in Vietnam is polarized: on one hand, many enjoy the tangible benefits of an economic system similar to China’s, welcome Chinese capital and tourists, and favor inexpensive Chinese consumer electronics; on the other, China’s incursions into Vietnamese-claimed waters—especially fisheries disputes in the South China Sea—have fueled resentment among many Vietnamese. In the face of frequent Chinese encroachments and the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s growing activity far beyond China’s coastline, Hanoi has decided it needs full backing from Western powers. Vietnam has chosen to join the Japan-led Pacific Defense Treaty Organization, vowing to defend its sovereignty at any cost."

  china.91.t: "Laos Joins the East Asian Defense Initiative"
  china.91.d: "Many see Southeast Asia as China’s “soft underbelly,” since Beijing’s assertiveness in the South China Sea has alienated a number of ASEAN states. One country, however, has stood firmly with China for years: Laos. Often forgotten, Laos is one of the few communist states to have survived the end of the Cold War, maintaining socialist ideals even as the Eastern Bloc collapsed. In the 21st century, close ties with China and Vietnam nudged Laos toward a market-socialist model that delivered remarkable growth and poverty reduction—while also widening inequality. With a new Cold War settling over Asia, Laos has again sought to reaffirm its relationship with Beijing by formally joining the China-led East Asian Defense Initiative. As lines harden across the region, Laos has no intention of being left isolated in the ensuing turmoil."
  china.91.a: "Interesting."

  china.92.t: "Nepal Joins the East Asian Defense Initiative"
  china.92.d: "A newly established communist republic only a few years old, Nepal sits uneasily between two giants, China and India. After a decade-long civil war, Maoists and Marxist-Leninists overthrew the monarchy and created a federal republic, which they continue to govern. Unlike many orthodox proletarian dictatorships, Nepal’s communists adhere to a path they call “people’s multi-party democracy,” making their policies far more flexible; they have kept friendly ties with both India and China. However, with the rise of India’s Bharatiya Janata Party and the post-nuclear-war pullback of Indian outward investment and tourism, Kathmandu has turned to China for security guarantees. Memories of the 2015 blockade—when India was accused of stirring unrest among southern Nepal’s Madhesi population—have resurfaced, and Nepal now fears that Delhi’s extremist revanchists may add Nepal to the list of territories they hope to fold into a “Greater India.”"
  china.92.a: "Maoists marching with China?"

  china.93.t: "Cambodia Joins the East Asian Defense Initiative"
  china.93.d: "Cambodia has announced it will join the China-led collective security alliance, the East Asian Defense Initiative—an act that may further consolidate Beijing’s military influence in the region.\n\nThe decision was unveiled in Phnom Penh during a meeting between Cambodia’s prime minister and China’s minister of defense. It comes amid growing security concerns among Cambodian officials, especially in light of India’s declared ambition to dominate Asia.\n\nIn a post-meeting statement, the prime minister said Cambodia’s entry into the EADI will help maintain regional stability and foster cooperation among member states. He also praised China as a “responsible and reliable partner” for peace and security in the region."
  china.93.a: "Interesting."

  china.94.t: "Sri Lanka Joins the East Asian Defense Initiative"
  china.94.d: "Sri Lanka has announced it will join the China-led East Asian Defense Initiative. Some analysts worry this confirms Colombo’s deepening alignment with Beijing and further estrangement from India and its allies.\n\nOfficials in Sri Lanka say the decision stems from a desire to strengthen national security and deepen cooperation with regional partners. After violence erupted within India, a flood of Indian refugees entered Sri Lanka, compounding the country’s economic slump and creating acute instability. As an EADI member, Sri Lanka will receive urgently needed aid, as well as military equipment and training from China to stabilize the situation. The announcement followed weeks of talks in Colombo between Chinese and Sri Lankan diplomats.\n\nSri Lanka’s move comes amid growing concern over China’s expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean, where Beijing has poured investment into infrastructure projects and established a naval presence at the southern port of Hambantota. The decision is likely to further strain relations with India, which has criticized China’s rising influence in the region. It also fits a broader trend—seen in countries such as Laos and Nepal—of states aligning with Beijing in response to uncertainty in India’s policies and the shifting balance of power across South Asia."

  china.95.t: "ROK Forces Cross the 38th Parallel"
  china.95.d: "Roughly 200 days after Kim Jong-un’s reported death from a heart attack, the DPRK has plunged into total anarchy, with Workers’ Party remnants, military cliques, and criminal gangs vying for control of what is left of the Juche state. Fears are mounting that one faction might try to leverage the North’s nuclear arsenal to gain the upper hand.\n\nAt 05:00 local time today, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Korea crossed the Demilitarized Zone and advanced north of the 38th Parallel—the first such move since active hostilities ceased about 70 years ago. The ground assault was preceded by a 30-minute artillery barrage and F-35A strikes to destroy surface-to-air missile sites.\n\nAt 08:00, the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President announced a military operation “to secure control over weapons of mass destruction and liberate the peninsula from communist oppression,” adding that the campaign is proceeding on schedule and is expected to achieve all objectives.\n\nConditions at the front remain unclear, but sources within the ROK military say their forces are advancing rapidly toward Pyongyang. Given the pace, the city could fall within days. Only time will tell how this operation unfolds."

  china.96.t: "The Battle of Pyongyang"
  china.96.d: "After unexpectedly stubborn resistance from North Korean army groupings and party troops, ROK forces launched a direct assault on Pyongyang from the south in hopes of a quick capture—only to be met with ferocious defense.\n\nROK armored columns were seen entering the suburbs and returning hours later with many vehicles missing and the remainder visibly damaged. The initial attack proved a complete failure, and disturbing casualty rates forced the ROK to attempt a slow, grinding encirclement along the mountains to the northeast, breaching layer after layer of defenses over the course of months. While the defenders’ lack of unity made coordinated counterattacks nearly impossible, dense fortifications and complex terrain rendered the advance extraordinarily difficult and costly.\n\nMonths after the first assault, the ROK mounted renewed attacks from the south, east, and northeast. With greater infantry strength they took more ground than before—but suffered heavier losses in the ensuing urban fighting. After final counterattacks by army and party forces were repulsed, the ROK finally seized the former capital of the old North Korean regime and declared victory."

As the EADI and the PDTO surge forward, the jungles of Myanmar ignite under incendiaries. Over Hiroshima and Osaka, the night sky glitters with a million fireflies as PDTO fighters scramble to intercept incoming PLA bombers.\n\nAsia’s ultimate war has arrived, and no one can stop it."

The Party is split.\n\nProponents argue we should accept. This is a chance to deepen China’s diplomatic ties with Europe and further erode Russia’s power projection in the Far East—perhaps driving Moscow out of Northeast Asian affairs altogether. Achieving that would cement China’s uncontested leadership in Asia.\n\nSkeptics urge caution. They argue our relationship with Russia should remain stable for now; we should not needlessly jeopardize the current peace. The geopolitical landscape is volatile, and wading into European conflict could bring unnecessary risks—especially if confrontation with Russia escalates into direct hostilities with unpredictable consequences. Moreover, the economic and strategic value of Northeast Asia is not what it once was; over-focusing on it would only waste time and renminbi."

After the rapid airstrikes, unsettling footage shows Chinese motorized columns crossing the border into Mongolian territory.\n\nMany analysts attribute this brazen act of aggression to Beijing’s increasingly nationalist turn and its bid to defend and expand Chinese influence.

The circular states that the eight democratic parties will suspend their functions, and that their social-organizational status and related activities will be incorporated into a new management framework.\n\nThe announcement declares that “the participating-party system has fulfilled its historical mission.” The headquarters of the democratic parties have been taken over by the military and police. Placement of former members will be handled by the United Front system. Several leaders of these parties have been asked to cooperate with investigations.\n\nThe military acted swiftly after the circular was issued, sealing the democratic parties’ institutions nationwide.

Meanwhile, the United Front Work Department will form dedicated working groups to train and guide cadres. The military has pledged full support for these adjustments and will station military representatives in the democratic parties’ organs to assist their work.\n\nNotably, personnel appointments and major decisions within the democratic parties will be strictly vetted by a newly established “Leading Small Group for Patriotic United Front Work,” and their organizational structures will be reorganized.

The realization came upon him as abruptly as the day, in his youth on the Wudadao, when he bought his first pocket watch—without his noticing, sixty years had ticked by. From his old house, the once-open horizon had long since been replaced by an unbroken chain of buildings, towers quietly taking root in this ancient land until they hid the sky itself.\n\nHe remembered that just a decade ago, he could still glimpse the outline of the Tianjin Eye from his attic; now that iconic ferris wheel had become just another ordinary landmark among the countless markers of this vast metropolitan region.\n\n“Imagine—the subway now runs from Tianjin straight to Beijing,” he would often marvel. In his youth, it had taken a rattling train carriage to make the trip. Today, when his grandson came to visit, the boy felt the distance was nothing more than the brief span between breakfast and lunch. That very morning, Xie noticed his old pocket watch had stopped—for the first time in sixty years. He shook the case lightly and heard a faint stir within, but the hands would not move.\n\nPerhaps that is what time is like, he thought—some things slipping away without a sound, others constantly being reborn, much like this city. From his window he could see a sliver of morning light shining through the gap between distant towers, a beam that crossed the entire megalopolis and blurred the boundary between Tianjin and Beijing.\n\nJust then, as he gazed out at the horizon, the motionless watch gave a soft click. Its hands began to move again."

  china.114.d: "Wang Zhiqiang, in a slightly cheap suit, tightened his tie and stepped—uneasily—into the sizable company. The interviewer, a middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses, sat with an air of authority. Expressionless, he motioned Wang to sit, then pulled a thick stack of papers from a drawer and slapped it down on the desk.\n\n“Wang Zhiqiang, correct?” The interviewer’s voice was low and firm, brooking no dispute. “We conducted a background check and found some troubling information.”\n\nWang’s heart sank; he sensed what was coming. Struggling to sound calm, he asked, “What sort of information?”\n\nPointing to screenshots in the file, the interviewer said coldly, “You posted insults against the motherland online and used extremely inappropriate language. Do you think someone like that is fit to join our company?”\n\nWang’s face went pale. He stammered, “T-those were written in the heat of the moment. I… I meant no harm…”\n\n“In the heat of the moment?” The interviewer let out a short, mirthless laugh. “Do you think insulting the motherland is a joke? Your words have seriously damaged the country’s image and reveal your lack of basic social responsibility. We do not tolerate behavior that harms national interests.

  china.132.d: "When the Chinese military government announced the dissolution and abolition of the Government of Japan, no one was truly surprised; some Western governments issued condemnations, but little more. For an adversary of so many years, China was certain to take every measure to eliminate any possibility of a Japanese revival or renewed threat. Partitioning Japan was simply the inevitable step to follow once the PLA hoisted the red flag atop the National Diet Building in Tokyo.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chinese forces will retain control over several key strongpoints—such as Yokohama, Fukuoka, and the Ryukyus—out of “necessity for safeguarding national security.” Elsewhere, several independent republican governments have been established “in accordance with the Japanese people’s autonomous will,” all under PLA supervision. Perhaps for the first time since the Sengoku period, the citizens of Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Osaka find themselves living under different banners."

  china.133.t: "East Asian Defense Initiative Founded"
  china.133.d: "At the Shanghai International Convention Center, numerous heads of state have gathered—most notably the host, the President of China. In recent months, not only have Chinese foreign ministers’ charter flights crisscrossed Asia, but ambassadors have repeatedly visited foreign ministries and presidential offices seeking endorsements for a Chinese-led proposal for an Asian security alliance. At last, these diplomatic efforts have borne fruit: the East Asian Defense Initiative (EADI), once only a blueprint on paper, has now become reality.\n\nThe founding conference featured the grand ceremony characteristic of China, with the highlight being the signing ceremony on the Bund. Naturally, observers are focused on the major changes this may bring to the region’s political landscape. EADI’s establishment is clearly a riposte to the Japan-led PDTO. Many also note the varied motives of member states: beyond military cooperation, economic considerations—especially China’s continuing large investments tied to the Belt and Road Initiative—are thought to be a key driver of accession.\n\nEADI’s creation undoubtedly increases the likelihood of a large-scale war in Asia. For now, peace in one of the most densely populated front lines on Earth rests on the prudence and restraint of decision-makers on both sides."

  china.134.d: "A surge in anti-Indian insurgent activity in Kashmir, accompanied by multiple clashes with Indian forces, has sharply heightened tensions. India accuses the Pakistani authorities of aiding these armed groups and, in retaliation, crossed the Line of Control to launch military strikes. This escalation has pushed the situation in Kashmir to the brink and spurred Pakistan to declare a military mobilization.\n\nPakistan’s armed forces are reactivating units and reinforcing key border areas, signaling little appetite for compromise or a peaceful settlement with India.\n\nReactions are mixed. Most of the Pakistani public backs the government, arguing that the nation must be prepared to meet any threat and to counter India’s violations of its sovereignty with force. Peace groups, meanwhile, express concern and call for restraint and dialogue. Yet a nationwide mobilization has allowed the drumbeat of war to drown out the voices for peace."

  china.135.d1: "Operation Gul has succeeded with the help of our military advisors and multifaceted intelligence support. According to analysis from the front, under our guidance the Pakistani military employed elite, high-mobility forces to carry out precision strikes, focusing on key Indian logistical hubs in Kashmir. This placed the Indian Army in a manpower and resupply bind, undermining its ability to sustain long-term mountain operations.\n\nThanks to the intelligence and strategic recommendations we provided, Pakistan’s combat effectiveness was substantially enhanced. The success of Operation Gul validates the practical feasibility of our mountain-warfare doctrine. For Pakistan, the operation marks a military setback for Indian forces in Kashmir, stiffening Islamabad’s resolve to continue the war while dealing a major blow to India’s offensive capacity. In the wake of this battle, Indian forces may be forced onto the defensive to preserve the status quo."

  china.145.t: "Conservative Pushback"
  china.145.d: "Those who had placed their hopes and confidence in a slate of forthcoming political reforms are likely to be disappointed. The latest statements from the Party’s propaganda and ideological organs have doused the rekindled political enthusiasm with a bucket of cold water. Both Qiushi Journal and Guangming Daily—two outlets that once served as key mouthpieces of the reform-and-opening era—have simultaneously published sharply worded essays by “anonymous commentators” criticizing a new wave of “restlessness and boastfulness” within the Party. By long-standing CCP practice, such anonymity is almost certainly a mask for senior Party figures. The essays conclude with a thinly veiled threat: “...whoever seeks to shake the leadership status of the Communist Party of China is indulging in sheer fantasy.”\n\nOverseas observers overwhelmingly trace this turn to the recently held Beidaihe conclave. Each summer, that northern seaside resort hosts the CCP’s top leadership for collective retreat and private discussions; retired Party elders are likewise invited, giving them a rare seasonal chance to exert political influence amid the sea breeze. Reports suggest that at Beidaihe, conservatives and elders skeptical of Wang Yang took aim at his bold reform agenda, and the political winds shifted accordingly.\n\nIn a subsequent public Central Committee meeting, Wang emphasized the paramount importance of Party unity. This has been interpreted as a temporary compromise—but everyone knows that even Wang himself will find it difficult to put his reform plans back into the bottle. The coming period will be a decisive inflection point for China’s future and fate."

First marked under Mao’s personal leadership in 1950, it continues to this day. National Day opens a week-long holiday known as Golden Week. Across the country there are celebrations and concerts, varying by year. When the date coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival, festivities become especially grand. In some years, the government organizes spectacular military parades and pageantry, with light shows on government buildings, fireworks, concerts, sporting events, and cultural activities centered on the holiday. Hong Kong and Macau also participate in the festivities. Despite regional differences across our nation, China’s unity is fully on display on this day. As a celebration of the Chinese nation, culture, people, and the system they uphold, this holiday should be passed down to future generations, for our country will only continue to develop."

  china.147.t: "Centenary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China"
  china.147.d: "Today, July 1, 2021, marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.\n\nYears of preparation have led to this day and its events. Nationwide publicity campaigns have run continuously, and Party history museums have opened around the country. Beijing hosted the first wave of celebrations, and beginning in late June, cities across China staged light shows—Changsha most of all. The National Film Administration instructed regional film bureaus, cinemas, and production units to promote and screen patriotic films from April onward, especially those depicting the history of Chinese socialism and the people’s liberation. Banners have been hung in cities, billboards carry slogans, and the public has been called to join the festivities.\n\nOn Tiananmen Square, a sea of spectators gathered as General Secretary Xi Jinping—joined by Premier Li Keqiang, former General Secretary Hu Jintao, and the Politburo Standing Committee—delivered an hour-long address. The speech showcased our resolve to the world: “The Chinese people will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or enslave us. Anyone who dares try will find themselves on a collision course with a Great Wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people!” Although the anticipated military parade was canceled, military aircraft still took to the skies under the Party flag."

  china.148.t: "Anti-Xi Protests"
  china.148.d: "It is late at night, yet far from quiet for a megacity of ten million. In a narrow alley of the old quarter, a vigil is underway. Men and women, young and old, wear black armbands; some hold candles. One by one they take the makeshift podium to mourn fathers, brothers, sons, and nephews killed in the Taiwan war. Sobs harden into shouts of fury: “Xi Jinping, give us back our loved ones’ lives!” The cry echoes across the city tonight.\n\nAcross town near the university district, radicalized students burst through campus gates and pour onto the avenues. They come from different backgrounds and hold differing views, but they are united in their loathing for the Party’s reckless military adventurism. White banners streaked with crimson characters read “Down with the Communist Party! Down with Xi Jinping!” Some marchers carry portraits of Xi and other leaders, now defaced with profane symbols in red ink.\n\nIn the police command center, the commissioner glares at the wall-sized screens showing multiple “riots” flaring across the city. When one feed shows demonstrators throw a papier-mâché effigy of Xi to the ground, sever its head, and set it ablaze, he turns to his deputy and enunciates each word—"
  china.148.a: "“We must arrest every last one of them; otherwise tomorrow it’ll be the two of us getting arrested.”"

  china.149.t: "Turmoil within the Party"
  china.149.d: "In a hermetically sealed conference room inside Zhongnanhai, Xi Jinping meets with his closest aides—the same room where he once gave the order to execute the Taiwan campaign plan.\n\n“Our diplomacy is isolated, Comrade Chairman. The war has badly damaged our international image, and defeat has made us a laughingstock. Many ambassadors have submitted their resignations,” the foreign minister says bitterly.\n\n“The army’s morale is low as well, Comrade Chairman,” adds a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, his face drained of the confidence he had before the war. “Several units have skirted the edge of mutiny; Party commissars and commanders are blaming one another.”\n\nThe director of the General Office rises to report, anger and helplessness mingled on his face: “Most worrying is the situation inside the Party: rank-and-file members, burdened with stability-maintenance duties, are grumbling. At the top, marginalized factions are stirring and beginning to link up to challenge your authority.”\n\nXi feels a stabbing pain in his head and rubs his temples. He is being forced to swallow the bitter fruit of his own short-sightedness, and his most trusted subordinates have little to offer."
  china.149.a: "Does no one truly know what to do?"

  china.150.t: "Standing Committee Resigns"
  china.150.d: "As if China’s current chaos were not enough, a new announcement—carried simultaneously by People’s Daily, Guangming Daily, Global Times, and others—has stunned the nation: the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress has “collectively resigned” and will soon organize a re-election. An NPC spokesperson stated that the decision reflects “specific political needs, the people’s expectations, and the volunteers’ own wishes,” and that it “accords with democratic procedure.”\n\nWhile the NPC wields little practical power in ordinary times, its Standing Committee formally holds the highest authority over appointments—including the power to appoint and remove state leaders such as the premier and the president. In effect, the country’s top leadership simultaneously loses its seats until a new NPC completes elections. This means that Xi and his colleagues have, for the moment, been stripped of the legitimacy to represent the state and administer the machinery of government. Clearly, this is a major blow to Xi, and many speculate it is a carefully planned counterstrike by internal Party opponents."
  china.150.a: "Has the Mandate of Heaven shifted?"

  china.151.t: "Factional Struggle within the CCP Comes into the Open"
  china.151.d: "Residents of the capital are often the first to sense subtle shifts in the political weather—and for that reason they tend to be jaded about back-room intrigue. Now, even Beijingers are discussing the latest developments in anxious tones: the newly announced election of the NPC Standing Committee and the NPC plenary session have been officially “postponed.” Word is that the decision came from the Politburo Standing Committee, which holds China’s real supreme power.\n\nThe leadership’s split has been laid bare for all to see, and policy flip-flops—such as last-minute changes to NPC scheduling—are Exhibit A. Party-controlled newspapers and TV stations now air sharply opposed views with diminishing restraint, and local governments are growing less fearful of central authority. As for the Party’s 90 million rank-and-file members, they are already headless and scattered—an army without a commander."

  china.152.t: "\"The Road to Comprehensive Transformation\" Announced"
  china.152.d: "Like the winding corridors of the Forbidden City, the operating logic of Chinese politics is usually veiled in mystique—opaque to outside eyes. Very soon, however, the CCP’s new top leadership shattered that impression with concrete actions that astonished the world.\n\nBarely after being elected General Secretary, Wang Yang convened a press roundtable in Qinzheng Hall at Zhongnanhai—one of the rare moments in decades when the very center of power opened its doors to the outside. Facing a room of Chinese and foreign reporters, Wang spoke at length about his program of reform. He stressed that he would advance the “modernization of governance capacity” through practical measures, placing the construction of “socialist democracy” and “socialist political civilization” at the very top of the agenda—effectively signaling the launch of a new round of political reform within the CCP. Wang also spoke with feeling about being received and encouraged by Deng Xiaoping during Wang’s tenure as mayor of Tongling—widely read as Wang identifying himself as a true heir to the cause of reform and opening.\n\nWang’s bold political declaration startled audiences worldwide. Many were exhilarated, calling it a first step toward liberalization; others argued that Wang would always prioritize making China strong again, and thus tensions in East Asia would not ease. In any case, his personal political courage has won broad praise—even as his reforms may meet fierce resistance inside the Party."

  china.153.t: "Foreign Investment Sparks Hardliner Backlash"
  china.153.d: "Vice Premier Lu Hao’s remarks in Shanghai’s Pudong—calling for continued optimization of the business environment—have ignited a storm. \n\nOn a prominent “red forum,” a veteran poster uploaded a dazibao alongside a photo of a worker with an oil-smeared face. The headline blared: “Forget the justice of Heaven, and wait for investors to rip out our backbone!” Most of the fiercest comments came from old-school leftists, who called courting foreign capital a betrayal of workers and peasants. “Investors prize the diligence of our people and the ease of industry; obsequiousness to capital will only repeat past mistakes,” wrote Su Tieshan, bluntly branding Lu’s stance a case of “spinelessness.”\n\nSome economists disagreed. In his column, Lu Qiyuan wrote: “The practice of reform and opening shows that attracting foreign investment is not incompatible with socialism. The question is how to make capital serve the people.” Younger users posted satirical memes: Lu Hao’s head photoshopped as half-robot, with the caption—“Business environment? What is this, a campaign speech?”\n\nThough pilloried online, Lu’s line has bought time. Multiple multinationals have reportedly pushed back their exit timelines. “Stabilizing foreign capital is only the first step,” said one official. “The key is to build a new model for external trade and investment.”\n\nThe debate rages on. In the comments on the Jiliu (Torrent) website, one user wrote: “We were too enamored of GDP in the past. It’s time to rethink our development path.”"

  china.201.t: "Nationalists Take Power"
  china.201.d: "Since the People’s Liberation Army declared martial law in Beijing and staged a coup to topple Xi Jinping’s government, only one point of consensus has existed among the factions: that the nation’s “humiliation” must be avenged. Everything else—China’s direction and the model of governance suited to its people—remained unresolved. Now, the answer seems to have arrived: nationalist heavyweights have clearly prevailed in the struggle at the top and have forced the other camps to accept their platform.\n\nAs an amplified, radicalized expression of most citizens’ instinctive national sentiment, the nationalists have resurrected a doctrine of Chinese exceptionalism—recalling the glories of the imperial past and extolling dynasties that expanded and conquered abroad. In their hands, the CCP becomes the throbbing heart that will restore national splendor. Beyond that, the hardliners advocate fusing traditional values with China’s pragmatic ideology and socialist spirit, forging a new value system that balances unity, revolution, and universal appeal."
  china.201.a: "Rise, Chinese nation—awaken!"

  china.202.t: "Digital Leninists Take Power"
  china.202.d: "Since the PLA imposed martial law in Beijing and carried out a coup against Xi Jinping’s rule, only one shared refrain has united the factions—that the nation’s “humiliation” must be wiped away—while China’s future path and the system best suited to govern its people remained unanswered. Now, that question appears settled: Digital Leninists have gained clear advantage at the apex and compelled the other camps to accept their program.\n\nDrawing sobering lessons from the bouts of turmoil that rattled Chinese politics after reform and opening, the Digital Leninists are determined—at any cost and by any means—to safeguard state security and regime stability. They prize scientific and technological progress and keep tight pace with cutting-edge developments, but their applications skew heavily toward social control and military use. They champion using technology to forge a cohesive society and deliver “good governance,” yet they are equally willing to preach policies that “dare to see the bayonet stained red” when it comes to enforcing rule and governing the people."

On his peaked cap, the August 1 PLA emblem gleams; on his chest, the gold Parachutist Badge, the First-Class Red Flag Medal, and the First-Class People’s Meritorious Service Medal glitter together in the light of victory.\n\n“Review formations assembled. Please conduct your inspection!” The resonant report rolls across heaven and earth.\n\nThe Dongfeng Mengshi inspection vehicle glides forward with steady weight, the growl of the engine swelling and fading. The General Secretary stands aboard, raising a firm hand as his gaze sweeps over ranks that stand like a Great Wall of steel. Xiang Chaomin’s eyes follow, his heart surging.\n\nIn that instant, he recalls the notched canteen and scalding liquor of Ye Zhiping, the old company commander from the Tashan position; above all he feels the century of vicissitudes borne by the soil beneath his boots—the pain of seventy years apart, and the glory of unity now.\n\nThe Type 96A tank formation roars past the reviewing stand, tracks clanking, the earth faintly trembling. Then come the armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and missile launchers of every kind—an iron torrent advancing to the cadence of war drums.\n\nThis is no trumpet for war, but a declaration of peace and a display of national strength. Xiang Chaomin’s eyelashes quiver; pride floods his heart. Such a spectacle is a deep consolation to the myriad souls who laid down their lives for national rejuvenation.\n\nOverhead, new-generation fighters of the Navy and Air Force howl past in formation, trailing plumes of color and weaving a tapestry of honor.

  china.206.t: "Report on Military Administration in Taiwan"
  china.206.d: "Reporting Department: National Security Bureau\n\nCore Conclusion\n\nAlthough the PLA has achieved a decisive military victory in Taiwan, the Bureau assesses that residual security threats remain at a high level. It therefore strongly recommends extending martial law for at least four months to thoroughly dismantle hostile networks and safeguard our national sovereignty and security.\n\nThreat Picture\n\n1. Residual Armed Activity\nApproximately 300–500 members of the “Taiwan Homeland Army,” together with remnants of Japanese forces, are dispersed through the Central Mountain Range.\nTwo attempted attacks on critical infrastructure occurred over the past 72 hours.\n\n2. Arms Proliferation Risk\nA substantial quantity of individual weapons from ROC and Japanese forces has not yet been recovered.\n\nRisks of Lifting Martial Law\nSecurity vacuum: Taiwan’s police capability has been reduced by 35% and is severely under-equipped, rendering it unable to handle hostile armed threats independently.\nLoss of order: A single major terror incident could trigger widespread unrest.\n\nNecessity of Martial Law\nEfficient clearance: PLA-coordinated, island-wide search and precision neutralization operations.\nReconstruction assurance: Military control secures restoration of key infrastructure.\nInterdiction of interference: Martial law provides necessary authorities for transport control and communications monitoring.\nTransitional preparation: Buys critical buffer time to rebuild the policing system.\n\nRecommended Measures:\n1) Approve an immediate four-month extension of martial law.\n2) Implement an “Eradication Plan”: establish a joint military–police operations center with real-time target sharing.\n3) Emergency weapons recovery: set an amnesty window and impose severe penalties for black-market trafficking.\n4) Civil transition roadmap: define phased standards for transfer of authority.\n\nConclusion: In this current “fragile window of victory,” the coercive leverage of martial law must be maintained. Lifting controls would invite a costly security disaster and undermine the foundations of our sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nCC: General Office of the CPC Central Committee; General Office of the State Council; Central Military Commission."

  china.207.t: "One Country, Two Systems"
  china.207.d: "Nearly fifty years ago, Deng Xiaoping—then China’s paramount leader—advanced a visionary proposal: after Hong Kong’s return, the principle of “one country, two systems” would be implemented. In short, while the Chinese mainland retained its socialist system, Hong Kong could continue with its market economy and capitalist way of life.\n\nTime has proven Deng’s decisiveness and creativity. This small island city has continuously channeled valuable investment and jobs into the mainland while remaining stable. After 1999, the same model also functioned well in Macao, the former Portuguese colony returned to China.\n\nNow, with Taiwan finally reunited with China after 1949, we will assure the people of Taiwan—and the politicians who have chosen to stay out of trust in the Communist Party of China—that “Taiwanese administering Taiwan” remains entirely possible."
  china.207.a: "We sincerely wish Taiwan prosperity and flourishing!"

  china.208.t: "Gradual Stabilization"
  china.208.d: "Encouraging news reached us today. Recent public-opinion polling in Taiwan shows a marked rise in satisfaction with the current administration and a substantial increase in support for our government. In addition, the Ministry of State Security reports a decrease in insurgent activity.\n\nThese developments highlight our success in reintegration and stabilization. With continued progress of this kind, full reintegration appears within reach in the near future."
  china.208.a: "Our brothers and compatriots will soon stand united!"

  china.209.t: "Unifying the Bureaucracy"
  china.209.d: "Our sustained efforts to reform Taiwan’s governmental structures reached a significant milestone today. Recent reports confirm that the governmental frameworks of the mainland and Taiwan have been successfully harmonized.\n\nAdministrative officials on the island have confirmed that government agencies, hospitals, police forces, and other critical sectors have undergone substantive reforms to align more closely with the mainland’s administrative architecture."
  china.209.a: "One more step toward utopia."

  china.210.t: "The Chinese Century"
  china.210.d: "“Comrades, friends, compatriots!”\n\nXi Jinping has never been known as a naturally gifted orator. For the past decade, every stumble in his speeches has drawn a wave of snide online commentary, and the few new turns of phrase his secretaries sometimes slipped into otherwise dry texts seldom stirred the people—even when they were later elevated into official slogans. But for today’s address, Xi is certain: no one will want to miss a single word.\n\n“Today, we hold a grand military parade to solemnly commemorate this historic milestone—the return of Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland!” Xi strives to keep his voice from turning too sharp with excitement. He notices that below the rostrum the audience is almost perfectly silent.\n\n“Looking back on history, our Chinese nation has endured hardship and humiliation, yet never abandoned the dream of unity and rejuvenation! The wheels of history roll ever forward; no force can halt the great tide of national rejuvenation!” His voice swells, and, perfectly timed, he raises his right fist to the Five-Star Red Flag flying high above Tiananmen. Satisfied, he hears cheers and applause boiling over. “Today we stand at a new historical starting point, bearing the historic mission of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation! We must unite the strength of the entire Party, the entire military, and people of all ethnic groups nationwide, of one heart and one mind, forge ahead bravely, and strive unremittingly to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation!”"
  china.210.a: "A speech for the ages."

  china.211.t: "The Fervor of the Chinese People"
  china.211.d: "Although we have completed the task of unifying Taiwan, the international climate is growing ever more severe and domestic challenges are mounting. We must therefore unite the Chinese people from different strata and regions more effectively. In the new era, ideological work cannot be resolved by a few slogans or a handful of films; it requires sound strategic guidance and detailed programs crafted by competent institutions. In this, no organization is more practiced than the Communist Party of China.\n\nThe Central Commission for Guiding Cultural and Ethical Progress, which sets the general line; the Central Propaganda Department, which oversees publicity and the news media; and the Central Policy Research Office, which develops theory and policy, have submitted alternative proposals to the Politburo Standing Committee. The more orthodox approach is to further develop China’s socialist theory—centering on the 24-character Core Socialist Values—to articulate a Chinese version of “universal values” and cement our status as a socialist great power countering Western capitalism. A sharper, more activist line is also on offer: given the increasingly tense relationship between China and the Asian neoliberal bloc led by Japan, the unity of the Chinese nation remains under threat. We could continue to foreground the nationalist slogan of “defending the Chinese nation,” while intensifying propaganda about the motherland’s strength and prosperity to ignite popular pride and a willingness to sacrifice for the country."
  china.211.a: "We must adhere to the Marxist–Leninist path."
  
  china.212.t: "National Rejuvenation"
  china.212.d: "The new line for ideological work has been finalized and is now being implemented under the supervision of the Politburo.\n\nThe Party’s propaganda apparatus has shifted more overtly toward nationalism. Publicity about the present-day People’s Republic of China is now frequently set alongside the prosperity and strength of the ancient Chinese empires—especially the Han and Tang—and hailed as yet another “golden age” in the history of the Chinese nation. “National unity” is also invoked more often: all fifty-six ethnic groups are said to have their places within the “millennia-long history of the Chinese nation,” together creating a “rich national cultural heritage.” Yet beyond the rhetoric of equality, the news and cultural sectors give greater space to the ethnic Han majority, and past Han campaigns of conquest over other peoples are openly presented as part of the nation’s martial tradition.\n\nIn addition, threat narratives directed at foreign putative adversaries are being constructed. The First Sino-Japanese War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Korean War are written about at great length as integral parts of China’s modern revolutionary history. Several earlier external wars—exemplified by the Imjin War during the Ming—are portrayed as rehearsals for a West Pacific Cold War, emphasizing that the enemy’s desire to destroy China has never died. Feelings of estrangement and confrontation between China and the outside world are becoming more pronounced; but across all manner of propaganda, whether a thousand years in the past or in the near future, China is cast as the final—and the only—victor."
  china.212.a: "Great-power ambition!"

  china.213.t: "Core Socialist Values"
  china.213.d: "The new line for ideological work has been finalized and is now being implemented under the supervision of the Politburo.\n\nThe Party’s propaganda apparatus is turning more explicitly back to Marxist principles. Publicity about the present-day People’s Republic of China is now often compared with the communist society envisioned by Marx and Engels, as well as with the Soviet Union at its zenith, and is hailed as another “milestone” in the development of communism. “Ceaseless self-revolution” is also invoked more frequently; Xi Jinping himself has emphasized this in many settings, declaring that the Communist Party of China will continue to lead China as the vanguard of revolution and construction. The twenty-four-character Core Socialist Values are now described as the “shared values of a community with a shared future for humankind.”\n\nIn addition, threat narratives aimed at foreign putative adversaries are being constructed. Not only the Allied intervention against Soviet Russia after World War I and the Soviet-German War in World War II, but also the Japanese army’s brutal sweep campaigns against the Eighth Route Army’s guerrillas—and the “color revolutions” sponsored by the United States against the Soviet-Eastern Bloc during the Cold War—are portrayed as rehearsals for a West Pacific Cold War, emphasizing that imperialism’s desire to destroy China has never died. Feelings of estrangement and confrontation between China and the outside world are becoming more pronounced; but across all manner of propaganda, whether in history or in the future, China is presented as the final—and the only—victor."
  china.213.a: "A socialist revolution for the 21st century!"

  china.214.t: "Great Rejuvenation"
  china.214.d: "The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has reached a thrilling crest, as the Party’s vision of a renewed China advances with irresistible force. Through decades of bold leadership, the Communist Party of China has carried the country from the dawn of the economic reforms of the 1970s to the global frontier of innovation. Now we stand on the threshold of a new era, in which China’s rapid rise as an economic and political power is reshaping the world order. Historians will soon recognize this as a decisive watershed between past and present.\n\nOn this unwavering road forward, the Chinese people follow the Party’s outstanding leadership. From the victory over extreme poverty, to the establishment of a comprehensive social-welfare system, to the launch of the grand Belt and Road Initiative—each epoch-making achievement reflects the indomitable spirit of our people. The Party’s guidance remains a radiant beacon, driving us to ever greater heights and ensuring that our transformative journey proceeds with unflagging vigor and dynamism.\n\nAt this exhilarating moment of great changes, China will continue to be rooted in the present while achieving ever newer and greater accomplishments. With confident stride our nation will move toward a splendid future, embracing tomorrow with ardent resolve."
  china.214.a: "Long live the glorious Party and the people!"

  china.215.t: "The 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of China"
  china.215.d: "The 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of China has concluded successfully. Since the previous congress, the country has achieved countless great accomplishments: a complete victory in the fight against poverty, fast and steady economic growth, corruption eradicated, superpower status consolidated, cross-strait unification realized, and imperialism together with its PDTO lackeys defeated. Amid the turmoil brought on by wars in the United States and on the European continent, China still stands in the community of nations as an island of peace and prosperity.\n\nAt the congress, Xi Jinping was elected General Secretary for a fourth term. In his address, he pledged to continue the course of recent years, to strengthen regional stability amid a rapidly changing global landscape, and to face the pivotal moments ahead for China.\n\nSome time has passed since the closing session. Xi sits with several senior commanders and officials in the screening room of the conference hall. They are locked in a heated discussion over a matter of great importance—one whose consequences will transform the world.\n\nOn the big screen in the center is a map of the entire Asia-Pacific."

  china.222.d: "A new plenary session of the CPC Central Committee was recently held in Beijing, with the Party’s top leadership in full attendance. On behalf of the Politburo, Xi Jinping delivered the report to the plenum. Unexpectedly, beyond the standard communiqué in bureaucratic prose, the session produced long-absent personnel reshuffles. At the Party’s highest organs of power, several cadres significantly younger than the current leadership were added as members of the Politburo or the Secretariat. At the next level down, provincial Party secretaries and heads of State Council ministries underwent even broader rotations.\n\nThe newly released résumés reflect a certain diversity: there are Party secretaries who rose from grassroots organizations, managers from major state-owned enterprises, leaders from universities and research institutes, and even soldiers who distinguished themselves during the Taiwan Strait war. According to CCTV News, this demonstrates the “diversified pathways for talent selection within the Party in the new era.” In addition, the official media, in a distinctively Chinese fashion, also signaled turnover at the top. At a routine commendation meeting, many former high-ranking cadres—who had disappeared from public view for a time—suddenly reappeared and, as “old comrades,” received the Party Center’s well-wishes. All this seems to indicate that the CCP is, to some degree, evolving its model of centralized rule and focusing on cultivating and selecting a new generation of the Party’s core strength."

  china.223.d: "Specimen RX-743 — Post-Mortem Report\n\nResearcher: Dr. Li Jiacan\nA male golden snub-nosed monkey, laboratory number RX-743, lived a short three years in captivity. Three years ago it was found emaciated, struggling to survive on the edge of a polluted grove. That was the last time we observed signs of golden snub-nosed monkeys in the wild.\n\nRX-743’s body is noticeably wasted; its coat has lost its luster and taken on an unhealthy, dull yellow. Its eye sockets are deeply sunken, and the inside of the eyelids shows an abnormal pallor, consistent with the severe anemia it suffered while alive.\n\nInternal examination: the lungs are filled with black mucus—the result of prolonged inhalation of polluted air. Pulmonary tissue is a diseased gray-black and lacks elasticity. The heart is abnormally small, with markedly thinned ventricular walls—myocardial fibrosis typical of long-term exposure to high concentrations of pollutants. The stomach contains almost no food residue, only a small amount of black, viscous fluid with a nauseating stench. The gastric mucosa is extensively ulcerated, and the intestinal lining is pocked with hemorrhages—symptoms of heavy-metal poisoning.\n\nExtremely high concentrations of lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals were detected in RX-743’s body. These toxins accumulated over time and ultimately caused its death. The sources of this heavy-metal contamination are industrial wastewater and automobile exhaust."

When our reporter arrived, the plant’s gates were shut tight and hundreds of villagers were gathered outside, visibly agitated. They said that ever since the plant began operations, it has released pungent exhaust and wastewater; after irrigating their fields, crops yielded nothing, and there have even been incidents of livestock dying.\n\nThe villagers said they had filed multiple complaints with local environmental authorities, but the issue has never been resolved. “They came to take a look and left without saying anything. No one has dealt with it since,” one villager said angrily.\n\nA spokesperson for the Luoning County Environmental Bureau stated, “Upon investigation, the plant does indeed present some environmental issues, and we have ordered it to rectify them within a set period. We have been actively addressing this matter, but there are many historical problems involved, and handling them will take time.” Our investigation found that although the plant holds a discharge permit, its pollution-control facilities are rudimentary and cannot meet environmental standards.

But habitat loss, pollution, and overhunting caused numbers in the wild to plummet. By the 1970s, the wild population was estimated to be fewer than one hundred. Although China launched protection programs, establishing nature reserves and breeding centers, and numbers showed some recovery, after the species was downgraded to a lower threat status, our observers went five consecutive months without detecting any natural reproduction in the wild.\n\nThe passing of the last wild Chinese alligator means the wild gene pool has vanished entirely. Scientists attempted to boost numbers through artificial insemination, but all efforts ended in failure."

Senior officials—including President Xi Jinping—and international representatives such as the sitting UN Secretary-General attended, underscoring China’s growing strength and international standing. Despite harsh sanctions following the Taiwan Strait war and the East Asian New Cold War’s drag on global trade, China nonetheless achieved average annual GDP growth of 5%, lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty, and raised its urbanization rate above 70%—far exceeding anyone’s expectations.\n\nIn his address, President Xi highlighted major infrastructure achievements, such as the expansion of the high-speed rail network to more than 60,000 kilometers, and advances in 5G technologies now covering roughly 90% of the population. In renewable energy, innovations have made China the world’s largest producer of solar and wind power, greatly advancing the country’s carbon-neutrality goals.\n\nThese successes lay the groundwork for the next stage of development.

This not only resolves a decades-old historical issue across the Strait, it also opens a new chapter of industrial integration between the two sides. Since the Self-Strengthening Movement in the late Qing, generation after generation of Chinese industrialists have pursued a single ideal: for China’s industrial strength to stand tall among the nations of the world. Today, that long-cherished aspiration has at last been realized.\n\nSince 1949, we have labored through countless hardships to build the framework of a comprehensive industrial system, and ultimately to fill that framework with complete supply chains. From an era when we could not manufacture even an automobile, to one in which domestic demand was met, we have now reached the point where shipping containers across the globe—especially in those Western countries we once looked up to—are filled with goods made in China. All these achievements testify to the greatness, glory, and correctness of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nChina is no longer the “sick man of East Asia.” We can now say with confidence: “Made in China” is our pride, and the products we make will be among the most competitive in the world!

This, in turn, shows that our consumer market is gradually casting off dependence on external markets and is trending toward a more independent and resilient development path.\n\nIt is foreseeable that, in the future, our country will progressively form a new economic pattern that takes the domestic consumer market as the core while still engaging with international markets."

Yet today’s fast-moving online discourse has pushed a flood of stories about migrant communities into the public eye, bringing a storm of criticism down on the government across social media.\n\nInternational observers warn that if the government fails to address the increasingly tense relations between locals and migrants in a timely fashion, the flames of nationalism could inflict enormous damage on the Party’s prestige."

The reform imposes strict limits on entry and residence, aims to reduce inflows of foreign nationals, and addresses mounting unease within local communities.\n\nThe new rules are designed to strengthen oversight of migrant populations, including more thorough background checks and tighter, limited work permits.

Many geopolitics experts, however, agree that the deeper objective is to safeguard China’s strategic interests in the region.\n\nUnder the banners of protecting the border and maintaining regional stability, Chinese forces crossed into Myanmar and advanced on key strategic areas.

Although Indian troops often press an advantage in numbers during standoffs, the PLA can now move elite formations to the front at unprecedented speed via Tibet’s new highway network—and launched a surprise night attack. Many Indian soldiers fell to their deaths retreating along mountain roads, including the spearhead unit’s commander. By contrast, PLA casualties remained in the single digits.\n\nAfterward, diplomats traded accusations of attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo—while simultaneously claiming to have defended their territory. Smarting from losses, India threatened to deploy additional troops to the front. But we have demonstrated the PLA’s improved mountain-warfare capability and resolve to defend the motherland.

The outcome is regrettable and disappointing, leaving our diplomats in Beijing somewhat embarrassed.\n\nHawkish voices in the capital are already urging a military intervention to compel this ‘ungrateful’ neighbor to recognize the imbalance of power and change course.

  china.236.t: "Blockade of Trade Routes"
  china.236.d: "Despite preparations, the pessimistic forecasts made before the outbreak of war have turned into an alarming reality. Dozens of trade-sanctions orders have all but severed official channels for importing raw materials vital to our status as the “world’s factory,” while some of our most competitive firms have been forced to halt overseas operations on the pretext that they are “aiding the war.”\n\nWe may still be able to rely on inland resources and relocate enterprises to friendly countries. Yet to make matters worse, the PDTO combined fleet has blockaded vital choke points such as the Malacca, Lombok, Makassar, and Miyako Straits, and has carried out missile attacks on our merchant shipping in the South and East China Seas. Geography is against us; our seaborne trade has plummeted to historic lows.\n\nAs the embargo bites deeper, clear signs of shortages and contraction have appeared in the prosperous eastern cities. The people now speak of the war in increasingly pessimistic tones, while officials sleep uneasily, recalling how Britain’s naval blockade drove Germany to famine and rebellion in World War I."

  china.237.d: "To General Secretary Xi Jinping:\n\nMy name is Liu Xingfu, from Ningbo. I joined the Communist Party of China in 1998. Since 2014 I have run a garment factory, exporting most of our ready-made clothing. The profits were enough to give me, my wife, and our son and daughter a comfortable life.\n\nWe built excellent ties with overseas distributors, and our goods could be found on shelves in Vietnam, Singapore, and Japan—until the Taiwan Strait war bankrupted the factory. I shut down the machines, dismissed the workers, and fell into high-interest debt. We had to sell our apartment in the city. My two children are still in school, but I can scarcely pay tuition. My wife is preparing to file for divorce.\n\nGeneral Secretary Xi, I wish to say that I always believed you would lead our country to strength. But now, this war has plunged countless people like me into suffering. Is this the “great rejuvenation” you promised? I beg you to end this war and bring peace back!"
  china.237.a: "“Capital has no motherland.”"

  china.238.t: "The Problem Partly Resolved"
  china.238.d: "News from Moscow may offer Beijing a measure of relief—and cause disappointment in Tokyo and Canberra. Since the Taiwan war began, naval blockades and economic sanctions have battered China’s economy, opening fissures in domestic stability. Now, the Russians may change the calculus.\n\nChinese and Russian ministers have signed a raft of economic cooperation accords. Core provisions grant tariff preferences for Chinese exports to Russia and open Russia’s Siberian railways, Central Asian highways, and Arctic routes for multilateral trade. In exchange, China must purchase greater volumes of Russian energy at higher prices, and extend more loans for infrastructure—especially airports and ports in the Far East. The Presidential Envoy to the Russian Far Eastern Federal District told Chinese media these agreements would “more effectively showcase the ‘no-limits’ nature of Sino-Russian cooperation.”\n\nWhile opening these “northern routes” may only modestly offset China’s lost external trade—and will take time—the show of Russian support could restore confidence among many developing countries that were wavering over trade with China. Moreover, Russia can provide credible protection for the new corridors; for now, PDTO missiles dare not target Vladivostok or Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky."

  china.240.d: "Since we began constructing drilling platforms in the South China Sea and stepped up resource development, the intensity of maritime standoffs with our neighbors—especially Vietnam—has risen by the day. Merchant ships from both sides now routinely come within a hair’s breadth of collision. Sailors in motorboats and speedboats chase one another across the waves, while naval warships from both countries appear ever more frequently in the disputed waters.\n\nGiven the absolute disparity in national power, many assume we can simply force the Vietnamese to yield. But strength also gives us another advantage: we can take the initiative by proposing talks first. We will deliver a diplomatic note to Vietnam offering two options: either accept the transfer of the Spratly (Nansha) Islands to China, or agree to share the rights to exploit and utilize the area’s resources."

In the end, Vietnam has bowed to reality and agreed to return the reefs and islets under its control to our country. Naturally, they will not hand over territory for free. They have named a price that is, for these features, quite steep; they also demand time for the Vietnamese military to dismantle its installations on the islands, and insist on participation in follow-on resource development.\n\nIn Beijing, some senior figures scoff at Vietnam’s conditions. Yet, given how far the talks have come, swiftly concluding an agreement may be the wiser course. Measured against the wealth of resources to be gained and the national pride stirred by restoring our territory, this bargain is clearly in our favor."
  china.242.a: "Opportunity knocks—accept the deal."

  china.243.t: "Vietnam Sells Spratly Resources"
  china.243.d: "Vietnam’s foreign minister has secretly summoned our ambassador to deliver a final response on the Spratly question.

They add that, though Vietnam too is mired in the oil crisis, they are prepared to sell energy to China at a low price and grant us a measure of freedom in resource development.\n\nIn Beijing, parts of the leadership are furious at Vietnam’s terms. Still, given the state of negotiations, concluding an agreement quickly may be the prudent choice. The energy secured can meaningfully ease our domestic economic crisis; as for the minor diplomatic setback—so long as we keep it from the public eye, it need not have any impact."

Simultaneously, countless explosions were heard in many coastal cities: our air defenses were engaging, shooting down enemy missiles aimed at our military bases.\n\nThough direct combat has only just begun, one thing is clear: the great war has opened— even if we had intended to strike first."

  china.247.t: "Total Collapse"
  china.247.d: "At exactly 12:00 Beijing time today, at an armistice conference held in Beijing, the Chinese delegation—representing the defeated side—signed an armistice treaty with representatives of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization (PDTO) member states, under the witness of the international community.\n\nAccording to the treaty, the size of China’s armed forces will be drastically reduced, and “weapons of mass destruction,” including nuclear arms, will be destroyed. The Japanese representative declared that “in view of the suffering China has inflicted upon the countries of Asia, restrictions are necessary.” China’s near seas will be jointly administered by the combined PDTO fleet.\n\nThe conference reached a climax over the question of ethnic issues in China’s northwest: “In view of the present Chinese government’s acts of genocide and oppression against local ethnic minorities, many delegations support the peoples of East Turkestan and Tibet in exercising national self-determination with PDTO assistance.” PDTO forces will also establish permanent military bases in the coastal cities of Dalian, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Xiamen, and place them under international trusteeship for 99 years.\n\nAs soon as the treaty’s contents became public, China’s domestic situation deteriorated precipitously. Massive demonstrations broke out in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and elsewhere, protesting both the PDTO’s unfair terms and the Chinese government’s incompetence. Various civic movements and religious organizations previously banned by the authorities began to stir. By incomplete count, several provincial capitals have already seen violent clashes. The people have long suffered from war, and the new treaty threatens to plunge China back into the “century of humiliation” of a hundred years ago. Although the central government has declared a state of emergency, in the face of nationwide turmoil the Communist Party can no longer maintain control over the localities. China is once again on the verge of breaking into pieces…"

  PRC_XI_JINPING_DESC: "Born in 1953, Xi Jinping once belonged to the illustrious “princeling” circle of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Cultural Revolution, however, his father Xi Zhongxun—a revolutionary veteran—fell victim to the era’s all-too-common purges, and Xi consequently lost the privileged life his lineage had afforded him. Like countless youths of the time, he was sent down to a dilapidated village near Yan’an. Some believe it was this decade of rustication that taught Xi the caution and forbearance indispensable to a politician; the future general secretary, they say, grew up in the cave dwellings of the Loess Plateau.\n\nAfter his father’s rehabilitation and graduating from Tsinghua University, Xi did not choose to remain in Beijing to start a political career. Following a brief stint at the Ministry of National Defense, he began with a low-level post in rural Hebei, then moved through Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces, accumulating rich experience and a reputation for modesty. Only when Party elders selected him as a figure acceptable to various factions—as Hu Jintao’s successor—did Xi truly enter his own era.\n\nOver the past decade, Deng Xiaoping’s blueprint for a “peaceful rise” has been gradually set aside. Through a sweeping anti-corruption campaign and an ambitious program of national rejuvenation, Xi fashioned himself into the undisputed leader of twenty-first-century China. He is neither a revolutionary like Mao Zedong, nor a technocrat like Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao. Xi carefully seeks balance among Party factions and across different social groups, and he knows how—at the right moment—to leverage the people’s loyalty and awe to achieve his aims."

For senior CCP leaders, who generally enjoy excellent medical care, this is almost unbelievable.\n\nReportedly, Li had come to Shanghai for a period of rest per the retirement arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee. After he fell into a coma, the Shanghai Municipal Committee immediately organized medical teams to attempt rescue, but to no avail. In addition to the official death notice, state media have posted memorial essays for Li Keqiang on social platforms.\n\nAmong the public, there is widespread sorrow at Li’s “untimely death.” Many praise his leadership in industrial upgrading, the Belt and Road Initiative, and his role in keeping the economy running during the Taiwan war. In Li’s home province of Anhui, spontaneous memorials have already appeared. His remains have been sealed and are expected to be flown back to Beijing shortly."

For senior CCP leaders, who generally enjoy excellent medical care, this is almost unbelievable.\n\nIt is said that, after resigning to take responsibility for defeat in the Taiwan Strait, Li was assigned to reside in Shanghai under de facto soft detention. After he fell into a coma, the Shanghai Municipal Committee organized medical teams to attempt rescue, but to no avail. Beyond announcing his death, the authorities have taken no further public action.\n\nIn the dispirited atmosphere following defeat, Li’s sudden passing deepened the public’s sense of disillusionment. Conspiracy theories have spread, alleging that the new leadership—fearing Li’s continued influence—had him secretly assassinated, or deliberately delayed treatment. Public security organs nationwide have been ordered to monitor and control dissident groups that might use the incident to oppose the new government."

  china.273.t: "Xi Jinping Thought"
  china.273.d: "In 1978 the CPC shifted from class struggle to development under Deng Xiaoping. The economic miracle that followed also brought mounting contradictions—ones that could not be solved by quoting Marx, Lenin, or Mao alone, but by seeking truth from practice. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the Party’s 21st-century answer.\n\nOutlined by chief theorist Wang Huning, it is less a prophecy of communism’s end-state than a synthesis of four decades of reform experience. It asserts comprehensive Party leadership over all sectors of society, while strict promotion systems and relentless anti-corruption keep the vanguard ideologically disciplined. To bridge internal divides it rallies around ‘common prosperity,’ the ‘Chinese Dream,’ and ‘national rejuvenation,’ echoing rising pride and demands for social justice. As Xi’s position consolidates, this doctrine will continue to guide China for the foreseeable future."

Only the giant screen behind him—glowing with a map of the Taiwan Strait—cut the gloom.\n\n“Further debate is pointless,” he said, voice brooking no dissent. “The general is right. In terms of international dynamics and our combat preparations, this is a heaven-sent opportunity to liberate Taiwan. If we look away, we will be sinners before the motherland and the nation for a thousand years. As Chairman of the Central Military Commission, I hereby order the activation of Taiwan Operation Plan One.”\n\nOn the left, the civilians stiffened with anticipation. The Premier adjusted his glasses. “Chairman, this decision may trigger sanctions and global condemnation. We must ensure the safety of traffic through the Strait of Malacca and commit every effort to destroy Taiwan’s naval power as fast as possible. I believe we will win—but we must be prudent.”\n\nAcross the room the CMC vice-chairman sprang to his feet and saluted. “Thank you for your trust, Comrade Xi.

Major mainland construction firms scrambled for contracts, while the State Council declared the integration of Taiwan’s economy with the mainland a major national program.\n\nPolitically, Taiwan remains under martial law until the island is granted what the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the National People’s Congress deem to be an appropriate status."

Since taking office, Xi Jinping’s government has pursued aggressive policies under the now-ubiquitous slogan “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.” Fears that strict curbs would tank the economy proved unfounded. Through industrial upgrading—most notably the leapfrogging rise of new-energy vehicles—greener sectors are now growth engines. Nuclear, solar, and hydropower utilization have all hit new highs. Cleaner air and restored landscapes have reopened parks and boosted tourism.\n\nOnce again, the Party has delivered: growth continues, and the environment people live in is markedly better."

In the most popular hall, large-scale models of current ships, aircraft, armor, and missiles sit in parade formation, delivering a visceral sense of the reformed force.\n\nOn CCTV’s military channel, coverage of joint exercises looks very different: fewer armored charges and gunfire broadsides, more squads advancing with smart tablets and robot scouts. Yet, every so often, a mysterious heavy system flashes by—a strange-turret IFV, a razor-edged black aircraft.\n\nFrom citizen to senior officer, few now dispute it: the PLA has become an impressive force, and its fighting power finally matches the image long projected in its propaganda."

The CPC Central Committee, NPC, State Council, CPPCC, and CMC issued a solemn letter to the nation.\n\nThough elderly by custom, Jiang’s death drew genuine grief. His tenure coincided with a golden era of growth, a flourishing of culture and entertainment, and an elevation of China’s global standing. His personal charisma—rare humor in a Chinese leader—left a deep imprint. A state funeral is certain, yet many flock to his old home in Yangzhou to pay respects in their own way—perhaps the truest measure of his stature."

Even as we advance, we must review and critique past errors; only then can we continue guiding the nation toward great rejuvenation. History is the victor’s narrative, and the narratives of the past were saturated with Western ideological interference and bourgeois moaning—fog that obscured our true program. Now we must part the mist and reveal the truth.\n\nThe Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were nothing but tools for Western powers to contain our rise. Since antiquity, the Chinese nation has pursued unification and national liberation, aiming to establish a new order centered on Chinese civilization. Marxism is not some imported Western commodity, but a system of thought deeply rooted in this ancient land. From the sages of the Shang and Zhou to the social ideals of later reformers, one finds a persistent glimmer of Marxism—proof that it runs in one lineage with Chinese civilization and is the engine of our national rejuvenation.\n\nWe will inscribe this new chapter of history into the nation’s very genes. We will let every son and daughter of China understand who we are, where we came from, and where we are going. We will etch this glorious history upon every heart and brand it upon every soul."

  china.159.d: "From the ice city of Harbin in the north to flowered Guangzhou in the south, from Shanghai on the East China Sea to Golmud on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, a sweeping wave of nationalist fervor has surged across China. Streets and alleys bristle with red flags and heaving crowds; the roar of slogans shakes the air: “Whoever offends China shall be punished, however far!” “Down with Japanese imperialism!” “Tokyo massacre—blood debts must be paid!”\n\nYoung faces, flushed with excitement, crowd the throngs. They never lived through those bitter years, yet from their parents’ stories, their textbooks, and the Internet’s amplifications, they have inherited a near-obsessive patriotic passion. Fists pump, placards rise; some of the most extreme banners read “Keep the islands, not the people” and “Nuke Japan.”\n\nIn Shaoshan, Chairman Mao’s hometown, tens of thousands don red-star caps and Mao badges. They belt out red anthems under banners declaring “Down with all imperialist lackeys!” Some descendants of the “Red Guards” even wear the old uniforms, Little Red Books in hand, shouting “Long live Chairman Mao!” and “Down with imperialism! Down with the Japanese!”\n\nLocal governments seem to be tacitly permitting the marches, taking no steps to disperse or block them. Some state media cover the events with headlines like “Patriotic enthusiasm at a historic high” and “Remember history, never forget national humiliation.” Online, nationalist sentiment spreads fast. Forums and social platforms teem with fiery anti-Japanese posts; some netizens even doxx Japanese firms and individuals in China, hurling threats and abuse."

Our ambassador firmly refused and noted that dispatching volunteers fulfills obligations under our treaty with the DPRK.\n\nAfter the frosty meeting, the JSDF announced an unprecedented naval exercise in the Yellow Sea—worryingly close to the Korean theater and to our naval bases and SAM sites on the Shandong Peninsula. The PLA Northern Theater is on high alert; air and naval units are surging, Rocket Force missiles are activated, and Space Systems are tasking satellites to watch Japan’s bases and ports.\n\nMemories of Japan’s surprise blows—from the First Sino–Japanese War to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and Pearl Harbor—stoke public anxiety and anger.

They fan hatred, hype the “China threat,” and brazenly drive an arms race. Seeing we do not fear their bluster, they now rattle sabers.\n\nLike countless rays converging through a convex lens to one blazing point, the situation has gone white-hot; the fires of war must now ignite. We will not be cowed by the glare. From the supreme commander guiding millions to the frontline soldiers at arms, the hands of those who defend freedom, justice, and peace will not tremble!"

Casualties at the front and losses in the rear continue to rise. The demolition of transport routes after the end of the “one nation” doctrine has crippled logistics, sapping momentum and morale.\n\nPDTO air support has reached the peninsula. The KPA can no longer sustain large-scale operations.\n\nGiven the current picture, the necessity of our own entry into combat has increased markedly."

  china.1010.t.1: "North Korea Agrees to Unification!"
  china.1010.t.2: "North Korea Refuses Unification!"

  china.1010.d.1: "Our ambassador’s proposal received a positive response—an excellent sign. Assurances of political and economic protection for Kim Jong Un removed the largest obstacle. With the DPRK’s fragile economy once more ravaged by war, refugees pouring into our Northeast, and numerous Chinese volunteers still on DPRK soil, the border has grown ever more porous—and ever less necessary.\n\nTo rebuild this devastated “hermit nation,” it must integrate deeply with its neighbor. A new Korean Special Administrative Region will be established on the DPRK’s foundations. Formally united with the PRC yet enjoying an autonomy nearly equal to statehood, it will run a reformed socialist market economy tailored to local conditions, drawing on “One Country, Two Systems.” Kim Jong Un remains the SAR’s head, but wielding far less power, with pragmatic economic administrators taking over most portfolios."
  china.1010.d.2: "Our ambassador’s proposal was rejected in strong terms. Kim Jong Un even sent a handwritten letter expressing deep dissatisfaction—a setback we did not foresee. In view of the sweeping economic and geopolitical changes wrought by the Second Korean War, we suggested transforming the DPRK into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC—retaining high autonomy while integrating into China’s economic system to rebuild livelihoods. Clearly, that plan will not see the light of day.\n\nPerhaps comrades’ advice cut against the Workers’ Party’s sensitive pride, stirring memories of the dynasty’s historic “sadae” deference to Chinese emperors and of past PRC–DPRK rifts over ideology and the nuclear question. As an overwhelming neighbor, China may not loom as menacing as Seoul, Tokyo, or the erstwhile United States—but the threat is real. Kim and his circle likely fear that surrendering statehood would unravel their dictatorship and that new ideas would unsettle society."

They turn a blind eye to the achievements of reform, sneer at the dynamism of the market economy, and even agitate “class struggle,” trying to inflame contradictions and sow chaos.\n\nWe must resolutely purge pan-left elements from the Party and allow them no space to make trouble.

They disseminate harmful ideas, try to erode public trust in the Party, and undermine our socialist core values—using the Internet to peddle slander and spread fear in an attempt to subvert our state.\n\nLiberalism takes root like a noxious weed in the minds of some, corroding ideals and loosening political stands. Losing faith in Marxism, they lose their direction and become pawns of hostile Western forces. On the road to national rejuvenation, we cannot afford ideological confusion or interference!\n\nWe must firmly clear out “democrats” within the Party, excising these ideological tumors to safeguard our purity and vanguard character.

With war underway, Pakistan urgently requested Chinese support. Given long-standing ties and the tense situation, Beijing decided to provide emergency assistance—advanced weaponry, logistics, and advisors.\n\nGeography posed major challenges. The high, road-scarce Karakoram limits overland movement; India’s navy has clamped down on Pakistan’s coast, severing sea lines. Under these constraints, transiting Afghanistan became the only viable route.\n\nThe PLA has begun moving materiel by air and land. Large PLAAF transports are ferrying tanks, IFVs, artillery, missiles, and other heavy kit. Elements are already departing Xinjiang, crossing Afghanistan, and entering Pakistan."

After war broke out, Pakistan urgently sought Chinese assistance. Given the long friendship between China and Pakistan and the pressing situation, Beijing decided to provide emergency aid—advanced weaponry, logistics, and military advisors.\n\nGeography poses major challenges. The China–Pakistan border runs across the 4,000-meter Karakoram, with complex terrain and poor transport links—ill-suited to mass movement of materiel. India’s navy has also sealed Pakistan’s coast, cutting its sea lanes. Under these conditions, routing through Afghanistan became the only viable option.\n\nThe PLA has begun moving supplies by land and air.

Ever since the day he learned his son had fallen in the Taiwan campaign, he had fainted and, upon waking, spoken no word—only staring blankly at the ceiling with clouded eyes.\n\n“Old man, what are you doing to yourself? You have to hold on!” Grandma Wang wept at his bedside. “Our boy is gone, but you still have me—your grandchildren too! Don’t give up!”\n\nZhang remained silent. A murky tear crept from the corner of his eye. Life had been too hard.\n\nHe dimly remembered his childhood in a small village at the foot of Changbai Mountain, with the Hun River winding by. He and the boys chased each other through the hills and caught fish in the stream. Poor days, but carefree. Then came the Mukden Incident—the Japanese seized Manchuria and everything changed. He recalled a rainy night, crying “Mother! Father!” The only answer was corpses and cold rain. Now his son had died under Japanese guns as well.\n\n“Japanese… the Japanese again…” His lips trembled, the words squeezing through clenched teeth. He tried to sit up, but collapsed, too weak.\n\n“Don’t do this to yourself,” Grandma Wang cried, rushing to hold him. “Why suffer so?”\n\n“I want revenge!

The consequences are dire. Our forces are battered and demoralized; readiness has slipped. Sanctions bite into the economy; investors, private firms, and major multinationals flee over stability concerns. Public anger swells. Though we tried to muffle news of defeat, mass protests demanding Xi and his team step down have erupted. Local police are overwhelmed; with the armed forces still disordered, only the PAP and various paramilitary bodies can respond—raising the risk of casualties as crowds grow and tempers flare.\n\nThe road to recovery will be arduous. Factional rivals within the Party may move. Hardliners in the PLA and the CCP, once back on their feet, might even attempt a coup. For now these are possibilities—but our priority must be a concrete plan to shield the state from enemies within and without."

  china.1011.t: "Mountains and Rivers, Different Lands"
  china.1011.d: "Nearly a century ago, under Matsui Iwane, the Imperial Japanese Army committed one of history’s most heinous crimes against humanity in Nanjing: three hundred thousand civilians—men and women, the elderly and infants, soldiers and non-combatants alike—were massacred. Though Japan surrendered in 1945, governments sheltered by American imperialism and Japanese right-wing groups long obfuscated their crimes, willfully distorting history to repaint aggression as a so-called “holy war to liberate Asia.” The righteous fury of the Chinese nation and the peoples of Asia has only grown. Now the final account will be settled.\n\nIf Japan refuses the language of peace, only strength will compel atonement. A unified Japanese state will cease to exist; the archipelago will be divided into a dozen independent polities. The Emperor has been publicly deposed. A new, China-led Far Eastern International Military Tribunal will convene in Tokyo to try government and Self-Defense Force “war criminals” openly and fairly. We will also remake Japan’s economy: break up the zaibatsu, overhaul finance, and dismantle heavy industry—until any chance of resurgence is extinguished."

  china.1012.d: "In 1972, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka came to Beijing to normalize relations, breaking the deadlock of the East Asian Cold War. In meetings with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, the two founders of the PRC responded positively to the desire to rebuild Sino-Japanese friendship—“Trust is the basis of all things,” they said, expressing an optimistic outlook for the future of bilateral ties.\n\nThough relations later rose and fell—ending, regrettably, in open conflict—Chairman Mao once observed that “the peoples of China and Japan are both victims of militarist regimes.” For the sake of future generations, the wounds of war must be healed in our time. With irresponsible rulers removed, the barriers preventing direct dialogue between the Chinese and Japanese peoples have been cleared away.\n\nWe will dispatch Chinese construction teams and volunteer groups to assist with Japan’s reconstruction and disaster relief, and we will restart youth exchanges between our two nations. Beyond that, we will help establish truly sovereign governments across the Japanese archipelago—free from foreign interference, entrenched clans, and monopolistic conglomerates."

Our forbearance was met only with escalation. Led by Japan, the PDTO repeatedly provoked incidents around our periphery, stoked friction, sought to split our territory and nibble away at our sovereignty, and drove us to the edge. Now only one choice remains: to use force to defend China’s territorial integrity and national sovereignty.\n\nWe love peace, but we do not fear war! We cherish life, but we would sooner give ours than surrender our national dignity! We will pay any price to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity! This is a contest of justice versus evil, a decisive struggle of light against darkness! We are certain that justice will prevail and light will banish the darkness. Victory will belong to the great Chinese people!"

  china.1014.t: "When That Day Arrives"
  china.1014.d: "Afternoon sun filtered through the pothos on the balcony, dappling the floor. Seventy-two-year-old Li Yugang dozed in his wooden rocker, steeping biluochun and listening to the radio. His son had joined the army; his daughter-in-law and grandson were away. Since his wife’s passing, his days had been spent alone in the flat—tea, opera, and time slowly passing. From the radio on the table came the anchor’s steady voice: “...The Foreign Ministry solemnly declares that the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization has long engaged in military provocations against our nation. Though we prefer peaceful resolution of disputes, in the face of encirclement led by Japanese imperialism we have been compelled to use force to safeguard our territorial integrity and national security...”\n\nLi nearly tumbled from his chair. The statement was long, but to him only two phrases rang out: “declaration of war” and “Japanese imperialism.” “War? We’ve declared war on the Japanese? Damn right! About time we gave those little devils a thrashing.” He left the radio on, grabbed his cane, and shuffled to the banyan at the compound gate where a circle of old men chatted and played cards. He joined them.\n\n“Old Li, what brings you out today?” one white-haired man laughed.\n\n“Stuffy at home. Needed air,” Li replied.\n\n“Heard we’re at war?” another asked.\n\n“Mm. Just heard it on the news. The little devils are at it with us again,” Li nodded.\n\nA veteran in a worn uniform said, “My boy’s in the service, too—he spearheaded the Taiwan fight years ago. The Japanese need another lesson. Eighty years ago we didn’t beat it out of them, and here they are again. If I weren’t so old and creaky, I’d re-enlist and crack some SDF skulls myself!” He brandished his cane, ready to charge to Japan there and then.\n\nSomeone hushed his voice: “Hey… the devils are cruel. Won’t they come burning and looting on our land again?”"

After a century of humiliation, we glimpse the dawn of national rejuvenation. Now the imperialist boot again tramples the Pacific, seeking to turn its blue into their colony, to tear our motherland apart, to plant their so-called “freedom” and “democracy” on the ancient soil of the East.\n\nWe do not flinch. We have firm faith, iron resolve, and the courage to fight. From glittering cities to remote villages, from snow-haired elders to wide-eyed children—everyone understands this is a battle for national survival. There is no retreat; only the river at our backs. Factories thunder day and night; workers rotate three shifts to forge weapons and shells. Countless young men and women bid farewell to their families and march to the front. To support them, the people tighten their belts, sending every saved grain and every inch of cloth to the lines. We will marshal every resource and unite every force to carry this war through to victory."

Hundreds of nationalists holding placards and banners formed a vast procession. At the front, a middle-aged man brandished a loudhailer—his voice, hoarse with anger, still poured out tireless denunciations of Japan’s past atrocities. “To forget history is to betray it!” he shouted at the top of his lungs. “The Japanese devils are beasts! They don’t deserve to live! We should wipe them out to the last, make them pay their blood debts in blood!”\n\nInside the mission, Ambassador Akamatsu Shūichi stared, grave-faced, through thick glass at the fury swelling outside. As the roar of the crowd crashed over the building, his hand trembled; unease and fear tangled in his chest. Such numbers, such rage—he could not help but worry: if the march slipped out of control, if the police could not hold them, if they stormed the consulate… He jerked his head, forcing the images away.\n\n“Ambassador, what should we do?” Takénaka Keiichi asked softly at his side. Akamatsu drew a deep breath, as if to press down his nerves. “Contact China’s Foreign Ministry at once,” he said evenly. “Request they reinforce security and ensure the safety of the mission.”"

Every citizen, like a cog in a precise instrument, turns under the Party’s leadership to contribute to national rejuvenation.\n\nOur people are no longer corroded by the decadent ideas of the West; their inner lives have been cleansed by patriotism and the core socialist values. They love us as children love their parents, as believers revere their god. Now that we have purged the enemy within, it is time to wash away our past humiliation with blood.\n\nWe will trample the invaders’ islands, turn their cities to ash, erase their culture!

They sought to carve our motherland into pieces like a fattened cake, while our people were reduced to pawns at their mercy. The Xinhai Revolution pronounced the death of empire but did not change China’s fate. Warlords fought, powers interfered, and the nation remained divided. Foreign forces never abandoned their schemes to split China—using warlords as chessmen, China as their board, and the lives of countless Chinese as their stakes.\n\nIn the face of invasion by Japanese imperialism, we never abandoned hope. Under our Party’s leadership, we smashed the invaders, ended a century of humiliation, and won national independence so the people could at last be masters of their own house. We took the road of self-reliance and hard struggle, overcame the blockade and suppression led by the United States, and achieved world-remarked success—allowing the Chinese people to stand tall among the nations of the world.\n\nNow the foreign powers have come again. They think they can once more divide our motherland. Do they imagine we are still the weak state of a hundred years ago? Do they imagine we will again swallow our anger before their invasions and meddling? No! With burning fury we will show them how foolish it is to try to tear our territory apart.

Atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, Li Zuocheng, in a black Zhongshan suit, looked over the tide of humanity as he strode to the podium.\n\n“Comrades! Compatriots!” His voice, carried by loudspeakers, swept across every corner of the square. “Today is a day the Chinese nation strides toward great rejuvenation—and a day when the motherland faces its gravest peril. More than a century has passed since the calamity of 1894. Through those long years our motherland suffered beyond measure—invaded by external foes, exploited by capital. For the sake of so-called peace she once swallowed her pride and struggled in humility.

  china.170.d: "“Professor Li Xuejun, we all know Marxism is generally thought to have originated in 19th-century Europe. Yet you argue that Marxism’s roots are in China. Why?”\n\n“I believe Marxist thought can be traced back to China’s Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.”\n\n“So you’re saying China’s socialist current predates the West’s?”\n\n“Yes. That era was one of great intellectual ferment. Confucianism’s ideas of ‘All under Heaven for the common good’ and the pursuit of a ‘Grand Unity’ bear striking resemblance to the communist society that Marxism envisions.”\n\n“You mean Confucianism contains the seedlings of socialism?”\n\n“In a sense. One of Marxism’s core aims is the ‘emancipation of all humankind.’ Confucianism likewise emphasizes ‘benevolence’ and ‘Grand Unity.’ The communist society Marx sought is, in effect, a modern version of the Confucian ‘Great Unity.’ Confucian thought influenced Europe’s Enlightenment and helped usher in the French Revolution, yet today most Western politicians speak of Marx while keeping silent about Confucius—that selective amnesia is a hallmark of how the West appropriates other civilizations.”"

  china.286.d: "To further deepen Sino–Russian cooperation, the government has agreed with Russia to found a Xi Jinping Thought Center in Moscow dedicated to researching and promoting Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The move has sparked an international stir, with supporters and critics locked in debate. Moscow State University—Russia’s oldest and most renowned institution—was chosen as the host. The center occupies an 18th-century neoclassical building, carefully restored and modernized within. Its library holds extensive Chinese- and Russian-language editions of Xi’s works alongside related research for scholars and students.\n\nEven so, the center’s creation has drawn controversy. Western voices accuse China of exporting ideology, while some Russian opposition figures are stoking a “China threat” narrative to sow domestic anxiety. At a regular press briefing, however, a spokesperson for Russia’s Foreign Ministry stressed that the center is an open academic platform welcoming global scholars for research and exchange—and that Russia has no intention of turning it into an instrument of ideological export."

Victory in this campaign, under the strong leadership of Chairman Xi and the Central Military Commission, showcased our fleet’s superb strategic execution and tactical ingenuity.”\n\nReporter: “What was the Navy’s most important achievement in the war?”\n\nAdmiral Dong Jun: “The most notable was the proven effectiveness of our anti-access/area-denial strategy. We not only destroyed most of the enemy fleet; our carrier strike groups, in close coordination with Rocket Force units, sealed the seas east of the Strait, kept outside air and naval interference at bay, and ensured the success of the landing operations.”\n\nReporter: “How will this experience shape our future naval strategy? What’s next for the Navy?”\n\nAdmiral Dong Jun: “We are distilling hard-won lessons to guide future planning and to strengthen our maritime edge. We will continue to build up the Navy, refine our tactics for evolving threats, and steadfastly defend national security, territorial sovereignty, and maritime rights—consolidating our standing as a great-power navy.”\n\nReporter: “Thank you, Comrade Admiral.

Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union and other socialist states, socialist China stood firm in East Asia and, following reform and opening up, steadily became one of the world’s most powerful nations. Explanations for how the CPC has consolidated its rule over a nation of 1.4 billion vary widely. But few would dispute this: under CPC leadership, no country can ever again humiliate China as in the past. One more thing is certain: §Rbringing down the CPC colossus would take nothing short of divine power.§!"

  china.174.d: "The latest session of the National People's Congress concluded amid scandal. While a speech was being delivered, uniformed personnel forcibly escorted Hu Chunhua out of the hall. The CCP's official statement claimed Hu left early due to a health issue, although on-site footage clearly shows otherwise. In any case, the meeting ended with a decisive victory for hardliners and the effective collapse of the unyielding opposition."
  china.174.a: "A miserable ending."
  china.175.t: "The Participating Parties Return"
  china.175.d: "In recent days, the National People's Congress and all the democratic parties have resumed operations. This is the first full restoration since their functions were suspended after the Taiwan Strait crisis.\n\nAt the NPC convened in Beijing, nearly a hundred delegates from the democratic parties took part. The parties tabled proposals and discussed issues such as economic recovery and social stability. At the meeting, the China Democratic National Construction Association proposed coordinated regional economic development, while the China Zhi Gong Party focused on overseas Chinese affairs, calling to maintain ties with and support from the diaspora. The atmosphere at the venue was solemn and orderly.\n\nMeanwhile, a CCP spokesperson stated at a press conference that 'the guideline of long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with utter candor, and sharing honor and disgrace has never changed. The restoration of the multi-party cooperation mechanism is an important step in national governance.' The revival of multi-party cooperation may again provide multi-angled references for decision-making.\n\nIn addition, experts note that in practice the proposals and supervisory roles of the democratic parties have already shown positive effects. Some observers regard this change as a new signal of adjustment in China's political landscape."
  china.175.a: "United, we forge a new chapter."
  china.176.t: "Interim Elections"
  china.176.d: "Given the current, complex international environment, the central authorities have announced the launch of nationwide interim elections. The scope covers all administrative divisions at county level and above, and includes pilot grassroots elections at the township level.\n\nThe elections adopt a multi-candidate 'differential' ballot system, and candidates come from diverse backgrounds. In addition to CCP members, they include members of the various democratic parties and non-partisans, as well as returning entrepreneurs and well-known scholars. Voters may cast ballots through an electronic voting system or via traditional paper ballots. The Central Leading Group for Election Work stated that it will ensure the procedures are open and transparent.\n\nNotably, these elections introduce for the first time an independent ballot-supervisor system. Each democratic party has dispatched representatives to oversee the entire process to ensure fairness and impartiality. Throughout, the democratic parties have participated actively, displaying unprecedented vigor. Observers note that this may change China's political ecology."
  china.176.a: "Winds of change...?"
  china.177.t: "Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Becomes the Second-Largest Party"
  china.177.d: "The Central Leading Group for Election Work has released the latest seat allocations: the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has surged to become the second-largest political party, behind only the Chinese Communist Party. The RCCK now holds more than 15% of NPC seats, nearly 10 percentage points higher than in the previous session. Seats held by the other democratic parties have also increased to varying degrees.\n\nAt a press conference, the RCCK chair said the party would continue to adhere to the guideline of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, fulfilling its role in participating in and deliberating on state affairs. Many political analysts believe the RCCK's rise reflects changes in China's political ecology and demonstrates the ruling party's support for diversified political participation."
  china.177.a: "This is our Kuomintang!"
  china.178.t: "China Democratic League Becomes the Second-Largest Party"
  china.178.d: "According to the latest data from the Central Leading Group for Election Work, the China Democratic League has risen to become China's second-largest party, with a seat share reaching 12%. This marks a notable strengthening of the CDL's influence. CDL organizations nationwide now have more diverse memberships, including large numbers of scholars, educators, and technical professionals.\n\nAt a press conference, the CDL chair said the League would continue to play its role as a think tank, actively participating in the formulation and supervision of national policy. He emphasized that the CDL is committed to promoting social harmony and economic development, and will focus on reforms in education and science and technology. Many political observers believe the League's rise reflects the ongoing evolution of China's political ecology and embodies the ruling party's determination to advance political-system reform.\n\nThis change signals that China's multi-party cooperation system has entered a new stage."

  china.179.t: "Chairman Wang Yang Visits Guangdong"
  china.179.d: "Guangdong...\n\nThis was once the energetic place where many young, promising politicians began their careers, where they displayed their talents as shrewd administrators and outstanding figures. Wang Yang is one of them. From 2007 to 2012 he served as Guangdong's Party Secretary, leading the province through the hardest phase of the 2008 financial crisis and witnessing the most dazzling moments of economic and financial prosperity.\n\nWang Yang is inspecting Guangzhou—the city-factory that supplies essential, inexpensive consumer goods to billions around the world. Here he sees clearly that Guangdong has become the bastion of his reforms. Here, people most strongly embrace the ideas of liberalization and democratization, cast off China's worst institutional defects, and, by drawing on the strengths of other countries, pursue national rejuvenation. Perhaps, if there were more people like this, China could attain the prosperity it has always dreamed of?"
  china.179.a: "We are only a few steps from success."
  china.180.t: "Unfinished Business"
  china.180.d: "Since the downfall of Xi Jinping, Wang Yang has worked day and night to heal the country's wounds, restore its strength and image, and rekindle the people's confidence and pride. Yet even as reforms continue, and however many corrupt officials are purged, one unresolved matter remains—like a sharp blade driven into the gut of every Chinese citizen.\n\nAnd that unresolved matter lies in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWang Yang and his political allies have never spoken of it openly, but everyone knows perfectly well that as discussions of reform, opening, and global cooperation advance, the day will come when China's Marine Corps must reassemble in Fujian and once again attempt to reunify the motherland. Not because the people want war, but because China cannot tolerate division.\n\nTonight in Fuzhou, Wang Yang tosses and turns over this question, weighing what has been achieved and every option he has. In his mind one thought is crystal-clear: the time to act will come soon."

  china.288.t: "A-Shares Crash"
  china.288.d: "As news of the oil crisis spreads across the media, a herd panic born of self-preservation begins to batter market confidence. Stock indices tick lower with each second; some farsighted participants had already pulled out their funds, but most retail investors can only watch their assets disperse like dust. At first they comforted themselves that it was a 'technical correction,' but those hopes were dashed—this was a genuine market crash.\n\nAlthough state media and certain outlets with an official tint tried to portray this crash as no different from those of the past, complaints have spread across all media and have already become a new tool—overtly or covertly—for discontented groups online to attack the government."
  china.288.a: "They were crazy for it before, and they are so now."
  
  china.289.t: "Workers' Protests"
  china.289.d: "With production and living costs rising due to the oil crisis, waves of work stoppages and bankruptcies have swept through enterprises across sectors, shattering the confidence of those who live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAs a result, laid-off workers in cities have begun spontaneously organizing protests. Angry workers stage sit-ins at government offices to register their dissent, or obstruct government operations in other ways. Although no large-scale violence has broken out, related photos and videos have already spread across social media, and the circle of participants keeps expanding. This has exceeded the upper limit of what normal government operations can bear and is forcing the authorities to deliver a concrete response that satisfies the public."
  china.289.a: "A stern warning."
  china.290.t: "The Oil Crisis Amid the Pandemic"
  china.290.d: "The effects of the oil crisis continue, and the public is broadly steeped in gloom and dejection—emotions that, unable to be vented, have finally erupted into a surge of discussion on online platforms.\n\nThe causes behind this surge are varied: the dull-wittedness of the bureaucracy, long-standing unfair treatment, and the loss of hope for the future. But there is no doubt that the shared purpose of the discussion is to express dissatisfaction with the current government. Official media outlets around the country have begun to block information, and this collective silencing by state media has only further stoked public anger, intensifying tensions in major cities and pushing people’s questioning of the Party and the state toward ever more radical tones."
  china.290.a: "Press forward under a heavy burden."
  china.291.t: "Political Stability"
  china.291.d: "After a series of efforts, our government has finally reached consensus on the present problems, and political divisions have been resolved.\n\nThe machinery of government is running again. What remains is to slot the technical issues into the now-open agenda items and resolve them one by one—until we erase every negative memory of this crisis. Then the people will remember our achievements, and on the strength of those achievements they will once again place their trust in the government and continue dedicating themselves to the grand blueprint of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
  china.291.a: "Stability overrides everything."
  china.292.t: "Economic Stability"
  china.292.d: "Thanks to the implementation of our policies, the economy—previously in severe dysfunction—has begun to run again.\n\nAs the obstacles to development have been removed one after another, the shackles on our economy have finally fallen away. Factories are operating again, enterprises have resumed business, and market confidence is gradually recovering. With the advantage of China being the first to emerge from the economic crisis, we can leverage our powerful industry to carry through the strategies that were temporarily shelved during the turmoil. Their renewed implementation will give the world economy a much-needed reassurance."
  china.292.a: "Fill those empty containers."
  china.293.t: "National Memorial Day for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre"
  china.293.d: "Another National Memorial Day; another December 13. In 1937, as the National Government’s troops retreated from Nanjing, the Japanese invaders swung their sharp butcher’s knives at people who had no ability to resist, committing inhuman war crimes. As the most representative and widely known part of all the atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese invaders on Chinese soil, it forever bears the Chinese nation’s pain and is remembered by every generation.\n\nChina’s public sphere is filled with commentary tinged with nationalism; but they ought to have this right. Just like other peoples who have been grievously wounded by history, they are entitled on this memorial day to voice sentiments that might sound extreme on ordinary days. Compared with the actual crimes of war, the plain grief felt by a people with a vast population and a powerful state—grief awakened by its past—is already quite restrained."

The People's Republic of China needs a new round of nationwide multi-party elections.\"\n\nThe line drew a rousing response and caused a seismic shock. Although Chinese society is now open, fair, and free, many still saw this as an ultimatum for Wang Yang.

The Chinese Communist Party was no longer China's sole ruling party, and from this day forward it was no longer a dictatorial party.\n\nThe Kuomintang was once the party in power—what an irony. Perhaps one day the CCP will make a comeback. But for now, the old 'era' has ended, and a new 'era' has opened."
  china.188.a: "The wheel turns."
  china.189.t: "Inauguration Ceremony of the China Democratic League"
  china.189.d: "The delegation of the China Democratic League stepped out into the dawn. Hundreds of reporters surrounded the venue, and a teeming crowd stretched into the distance. There were no protests, no tears, no complaints—only cheers for the new national leaders.\n\nDing Zhongli stepped before the lens and began answering questions from reporters.\nHe reaffirmed the League’s platform points.\nAnd he made new promises.\n\nYes—the whole nation was watching, the whole nation jubilant. The Chinese Communist Party was no longer China's sole ruling party, and from this day forward it was no longer a dictatorial party.\n\nThe sun rose, and Wang Yang’s decisions began to make themselves felt across China. Perhaps one day the CCP will make a comeback. But for now, the old 'era' has ended, and a new 'era' has opened."
  china.189.a: "China yearns for the new."
  china.190.t: "Spring Nears Its End"
  china.190.d: "After brief debates in the media and deliberations in the National People's Congress, the episode of the democratic parties’ ultimatum came to a close. The word 'election' vanished from official outlets, and dozens of demonstrations across China’s major cities were crushed by high-pressure water cannons, tear gas, and stun grenades.\n\nIn the end, all talk of democracy, social mobility, and freedom became a fig leaf for the oligarchic politics that emerged behind Wang Yang’s rise. Thousands of appointees, collaborators, and corrupt officials are shoring up their positions.\n\nNow that enterprises can sleep easy, they will not pass up the juicy cut of meat that is the CCP and Wang Yang. The Party and its leader have been reduced to instruments for corporations to control every corner of China; the levers of the economy and the public purse have fallen wholly into the hands of bureaucratic capital.\n\nThe Chinese people still enjoy more freedoms and opportunities than before—at least for a brief spell, until those aims are secured. Will Wang Yang be remembered as a liberator? Or spat upon for his indecision?\n\nLet right and wrong, merit and fault, be judged by those who come after."
  china.190.a: "Too many questions, no answers."
  china.191.t: "The CCP’s New Session"
  china.191.d: "As Wang Yang adjusted his dazzling tie, optimism swelled in his heart. After long effort, the Party’s reform was finally complete. It gathered the myriad ideas of the Chinese people. Never in China’s history had there been such a moment of a hundred flowers in bloom.\n\nAfter preparations, Wang at last entered the Great Hall to thunderous applause from thousands of delegates. Today, each platform would present its program to the congress, and the vote would decide who would lead the People’s Republic of China in the coming years.\n\nNow that these few crucial days have ended, Wang Yang is ready to announce the result:"
  china.191.a: "The old ways always work."

  china.296.d: "During Hu Chunhua’s reform period, discontent within the CCP gradually fermented. It was precisely those seemingly minor, long-overlooked details that became the last straw to shatter the Party’s institutional foundations. What began as dissatisfaction confined to local quarrels has escalated to declaring the Politburo illegitimate and calling a special congress to strip Hu Chunhua of his position.\n\nHu himself—together with his supporters and reformist colleagues—strained every nerve to avert such a rupture. Even so, a variety of platforms sprang up alongside the Party’s internal turmoil. Many radical reformers voiced support for the collapse of one-party rule. Before long, the factions proclaimed independence one after another and split into separate political parties.\n\nNow, Hu Chunhua leads a smaller offshoot of the former CCP, composed of his supporters and pragmatists—people who know that China’s future will move forward beyond the Communist Party."
  china.296.a: "New China will continue down a path without the Communist Party."
  china.297.t: "China’s General Election"
  china.297.d: "The hands of history point to a decisive moment. Today, the Second Session of the National People’s Congress opened to the solemn strains of the national anthem. Under the newly revised Constitution and Electoral Law, the election of the State President will be conducted among candidates nominated by four parties: the Communist Party of China, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Peasants’ and Workers’ Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society. The election will strictly adhere to the principles of openness, fairness, and impartiality, fully safeguarding every deputy’s democratic rights to ensure the result truly reflects the people’s will. The outcome will be announced by the Presidium of the NPC and promulgated by the NPC.\n\nAt the moment of the announcement, a hush fell over the Great Hall of the People. Nearly three thousand deputies from across the country held their breath, awaiting the Presidium to declare the result of the count.\n\n“According to the election results, the new President of the People’s Republic of China will be…”"

  china.298.t: "Award the Medal of the Republic to Zhong Nanshan"
  china.298.d: "Recently, Xi Jinping, President of China, signed a presidential order awarding the 'Medal of the Republic' to Zhong Nanshan, now in his eighties, in recognition of his outstanding contributions during the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The public notice for nominees stated that after the outbreak of COVID-19, Zhong 'dared to practice medicine and to speak out,' identified human-to-human transmission, stressed strict containment, and led the drafting of treatment protocols—making outstanding contributions to epidemic prevention and control, critical-care treatment, and scientific research.\n\nAlthough Zhong has received the highest state honor of the People’s Republic—an affirmation of his work by the nation—he remains a controversial figure online. Many netizens question his public statements and, citing real-world cases, accuse his medication advice and the government’s community-level prevention-and-control measures he represented of having harmed many people. Setting neutrals aside, state media and another cohort of supportive netizens denounce the attacks on him as rumor-mongering and online abuse, asserting that critics are paid online brigades financed by Western countries or misled by them. Overall, however, Chinese public opinion has largely offered its congratulations on the award."
  china.298.a: "Zhong Nanshan of the Chinese People!"
  china.299.t: "Li Wenliang Has Died"
  china.299.d: "Li Wenliang, a physician known as the 'whistleblower' of the pandemic, passed away today. As the first doctor to identify the novel coronavirus, he rose from an ordinary staff member at Wuhan Central Hospital to a nationally recognized public figure. His decisive act of alerting his colleagues undoubtedly saved many lives worldwide; for this, many Chinese feel deep gratitude and admiration.\n\nOnce the news broke, grief swept across nearly all of China. Memorial events surged, and countless people commemorated the doctor. Not long ago, Li had also been a figure of controversy: for 'posting false statements on the internet,' he was warned and admonished by a police station—an admonition letter that, to this day, has not been rescinded, arousing public dissatisfaction.\n\nEven after his death, the debate did not rest. Some argue over whether he should be called a hero; some caution against magnifying his personal halo; many subsequent disputes center on whether the deceased is being exploited for attention. Different views spread rapidly, but the underlying tone remained one of mourning his passing."
  china.299.a: "Honor the deceased."
  
  china.300.t: "Troops Descend from the Heavens"
  china.300.d: "A heavy blanket of cloud divided sky from earth; from above, the outlines of cities on the ground were only faintly visible, and at night the neon lights would at times dye the clouds purple or orange-yellow.\n\nYet Chen Zihua, seated in the Y-20 transport, could see none of it. As the aircraft droned and spiraled down, all he could do—nerves taut—was replay, again and again, what had happened four hours earlier. At the blare of the midnight alarm he had tumbled from his bunk and sprinted to the parade ground, where, in the cold wind, he listened to the commander’s speech and learned that he and his comrades had been chosen as the first advance detachment to support Wuhan. After hastily writing a letter to his family (very likely a final testament), these half-grown lads, together with crate after crate of medical supplies, crossed half of China and now hovered over a city in disaster.\n\nBy the cabin lights that flickered from bright to dim, Chen quietly studied his comrades. “Big Tiger” could snore away even on a jolting plane—who knew how many sound sleeps he would get once they reached Wuhan. “Hammer” murmured under his breath with head bowed; the hand clenched tight in his breast pocket was surely gripping his girlfriend’s photograph. Closest to the hatch sat the company political instructor. He was as motionless as a statue—brows relaxed, eyes bright, spirit high—as if leading the unit to the front were nothing more than another drill on the training ground. Looking at that calm face, Chen felt his own fear begin to ebb.\n\nAt that moment, with a sharp clack, the landing gear kissed the runway for the first time, and the aircraft thumped down. Before the plane had even come to a full stop, the soldiers were on their feet, squaring away their gear and gathering the supplies. The ramp began to lower. The instructor stood, turned to the men, and, in his loudest voice, called out: “Comrades…”"
  china.300.a: "“…the time has come for the Party and the people to put us to the test!”"
  china.301.t: "Quarantine Transfer Bus Overturns"
  china.301.d: "In Guizhou Province, a bus requisitioned to transport quarantined persons overturned at the 32-kilometer mark of the Sandu–Libo Expressway in Qiannan Prefecture, plunging into a deep roadside gully. The accident left 27 dead; 20 injured were rushed to nearby hospitals. After active treatment, four seriously injured patients are currently out of immediate danger, and the remaining sixteen are in stable condition.\n\nIn the aftermath, the relevant departments launched an immediate response. At the same time, official Chinese outlets quickly addressed the public, expressing deep condolences and firm resolve. The cause is still under investigation, but three officials have already been removed from their posts."
  china.301.a: "Oh my..."
  china.302.t: "PLA Races to Aid Wuhan"
  china.302.d: "The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus has shaken order across almost all of Hubei. Ignoring provincial restrictions on travel and going out, people scrambled to flee affected cities by car, leaving the province’s expressways choked solid. Given Hubei’s fame as the “thoroughfare of nine provinces,” the present chaos is bitterly ironic.\n\nThis is truly a moment of life-and-death peril; civil institutions alone can no longer control the epidemic or restore order. The Central Military Commission therefore issued orders for units of the PLA Central Theater Command to be the first to race to Hubei, with forces from other regions to follow. Multiple medical teams have already arrived at Wuhan by transport aircraft. Emergency supplies—masks, protective suits, ethanol alcohol, and more—have been shipped to the epidemic zones by military trucks and rail.\n\nNext, PLA officers and soldiers will formally assume responsibility for maintaining order and public security throughout the province. They are also entrusted with arduous tasks: distributing essential goods, building temporary hospitals and shelters, and assisting medical personnel in treatment."
  china.302.a: "The PLA is the sea-calming needle."
  china.192.t: "A Gentle Spring Breeze"
  china.192.d: "After the rain, a slight chill still lingered in Shanghai’s air, yet the Bund was already ablaze with life. From the Shanghai Tower, soaring into the clouds, he looked down: rivers of traffic below; ranks of high-rises proclaiming the city’s vitality. In decades of political life, Wang Yang had weathered many storms and tempests; now, for the first time, he felt an unprecedented ease.\n\nCompared with the past, the social climate at home was growing more open. Online, young people could voice their views; in streets and alleys, ordinary folks could discuss current affairs without the old fear that the police would come knocking just for talking politics. And within the system? Perhaps transparency was taking root there as well: some officials were trying to communicate in more open ways; some local governments were even experimenting with deeper democratic decision-making. Power was no longer a toy for the few; it operated in the sunlight under public scrutiny.\n\nFor Wang Yang, perhaps China’s democracy was greeting its first spring."
  china.192.a: "The spring breeze greens the southern banks once more."
  china.193.t: "“I Have a Dream…”"
  china.193.d: "Wang Yang set down the file and rubbed his tired eyes. Outside, birdsong mingled with a distant murmur—as if two different worlds. He rose and went to the window, gazing out at the ancient capital.\n\nOnce, autocracy had been an invisible shackle, fettering the people’s thoughts and actions. Now that ancient, decayed system had come to its end—an old man with one foot in the grave, no longer fit for a new era. Yet the lofty conservatives strained to preserve the old order and resist the tide of reform, trying to smother it in the cradle. In the end, however, the people chose freedom, and at last they had a chance to fulfill their long-held hopes.\n\nHe turned back to his desk. Before him lay a stack of proposals on political reform. Once launched, they would surely set off a storm. But Wang Yang knew the path of reform was never smooth: to lead China truly toward democracy and the rule of law, one had to gnaw through this “hard bone.” He picked up his pen and solemnly signed his name…"
  china.193.a: "It’s time to let new birds fly in."
  china.194.t: "Religious Liberation"
  china.194.d: "This time, Tashi Tsering had come a long way from his home near Shigatse—not only to complete a pilgrimage, but to witness with his own eyes the changes at Sera Monastery. Back in Pazhong Village he had heard all kinds of rumors that the government’s religious policy was subtly shifting. He was half skeptical. Since childhood he had heard his elders speak of old Tibet’s sufferings, and he had also seen the remarkable changes in his home under the Party’s leadership. In his bones, he still trusted the Party and the government.\n\nHe climbed the stone steps toward the monastery. At the gate he noticed that the slogans that used to stand in the landscaped verge were gone. Could the rumors be true? Hurrying inside, he saw monks still in their maroon robes and the Buddhas still gazing toward the snowy peaks—everything seemed unchanged. But then he noticed monks taking down from the wall the banner that read “Unite around the Communist Party” and carrying it out. He approached an old monk sunning himself, bowed respectfully, and asked, “Elder, why are these slogans being removed?”\n\nThe old monk smiled. “You don’t know—policy has changed. The Communist Party says it will respect our faith more. The compulsory measures of the past have been changed to a needs-based approach. We can freely express our views. I reckon it won’t be long before the Party stops restricting us altogether.”"
  china.194.a: "Knowing the worldly is but illusion, blame none and harbor no anger."
  china.303.t: "The Road Home"
  china.303.d: "As the epidemic spread, Foxconn’s Zhengzhou plant could not escape its effects. The industrial park, home to hundreds of thousands, implemented multiple zero-COVID measures. But as the outbreak widened and confirmed cases rose, resources grew ever scarcer. For lack of space, the factory had to isolate positives in the dorms; logistics collapsed; food and medicine were in acute shortage; what little workers received was often spoiled. The factory never published case counts; workers could only guess the park’s situation through private chats and word of mouth. Fear of infection led to widespread absences on the lines, which in turn pressured the factory to push workers harder back into the workshops for the sake of output.\n\nRumors and panic seeped through the plant. A coworker who tested positive might share your dorm or stand next to you on the line as a close contact; propaganda about the dire consequences of infection saturated society. The pressures mounted on the workers’ nerves until, finally, they decided to set out for home. Avoiding security, they climbed over walls and slipped through holes in fences, setting out on foot along the highways for dozens—sometimes hundreds—of kilometers. Many kindhearted people left food and water by the roadside; some drivers, unable to bear it, took the risk of giving them rides home.\n\nSince the incident, Foxconn has yet to issue any comment."

  china.304.d: "Stepping out through the prison gates, Zhong Yongji found everything before him strangely unfamiliar. A dozen years behind bars had worn down the once high-spirited deputy director of public security into an old man with graying temples and a faltering gait. In a worn jacket and carrying a slightly faded briefcase, he stood blankly at the entrance, gazing at the distant high-rises, feelings churning. In 2012 he had been thrown into jail for the crime of “privately carrying and reading reactionary books.” His former power and status vanished in an instant. Now he was out at last—yet he had no idea where to go.\n\nHe wandered aimlessly along the road until a taxi approached. He raised his hand; it eased to a stop beside him. “Where to, sir?” the driver asked. Zhong hesitated, then finally gave the address that had tugged at his soul for more than ten years. The taxi carried him through streets at once familiar and strange. Everything had changed beyond recognition—except that he was still stuck in the past.\n\nAfter an indeterminate time, the taxi stopped. Zhong paid the fare and got out. The sight before him left him overwhelmed. The housing block was the same, yet the buildings looked older than in memory. Patches of plaster had flaked away to reveal the gray brick beneath; a musty smell filled the stairwell.\n\nDrawing a deep breath, Zhong stepped into the stairwell. Guided by memory, he groped his way to his own door. Before the rust-scarred iron gate, his hand trembled. However many years had passed, he was finally back. Slowly he raised his hand to knock—but it felt so heavy it could scarcely be lifted.\n\n“咚咚咚……” After long hesitation, he finally summoned the courage to rap lightly on the door."

  china.305.t: "Red Flag Reborn"
  china.305.d: "Nearly a century ago, a small guerrilla band led by Mao Zedong set out for the mighty Jinggang Mountains. Not even the boldest prophet would have dared predict that such a humble force could liberate all of China. In the end, they did not collapse before foreign enemies, but were thwarted by traitors from within. The so-called “socialism with Chinese characteristics” has at its core nothing more than “capitalism with Chinese characteristics.” Forty years of reform and opening have yielded widening wealth gaps and social inequality; the fruits of growth are enjoyed only by a few.\n\nPeople often ask: Why did socialism make the poor poorer and the rich richer? No one seems able to answer.\n\nIn such a climate, the dreams that faded years ago come back to mind. A new leadership under Hu Chunhua has resolved to reclaim those lost ideals, however arduous the path. They will strive with all their might to find the utopia of their ideals—whether by retracing the old road of the Mao era or by striking out on an unimagined new one. This “second revolution” will overturn the unequal system erected by revisionists and raise a new world from its ruins."

  china.306.t: "CCTV Criticizes Confucianism"
  china.306.d: "For many years, watching programs on CCTV’s Science and Education Channel after dinner had been an unshakable habit for three generations of the Zhang family. Now the middle-schooler grandson, Zhang Keren, had joined in. On another quiet evening, with his homework finished, Zhang Keren sat in a row before the TV with his father, Zhang Zhongshu, just home from work, and his cane-bearing grandfather, Zhang Shili. The title animation of “Lecture Room” scrolled before their eyes.\n\nGrandfather Zhang had always loved the program. As an old Party member and a scholar with traditional Chinese bearing, he had long held that reverence for Chairman Mao and respect for the Most Sage Confucius could coexist without contradiction. Today, though, something felt off. Although the esteemed professor on stage was explicating the Analects and the Classic of Filial Piety, his register was no longer the familiar “adapting the ancients for the present” and “learning for practical use.” Hearing talk of “critiquing feudal, foolish filial piety” and “Confucius’s own class limitations,” the old man felt a nameless pang of dread. The program felt strange to him.\n\n“Son, what do you think of what he’s saying?” he turned and asked his son, Zhang Zhongshu.\n\nZhongshu, typing a reply on his phone, glanced up, shot a quick look at the TV, and answered half in earnest, half to oblige: “I think, as children, we still ought to be filial—we should treat our parents well.” The reassuring answer made the old man nod in satisfaction, but it drew his grandson’s objection.\n\n“Grandpa, I think the professor has a point,” the grandson, Keren, chimed in. “Sure, it makes sense to be good to Mom and Dad and to our grandparents—but kids and grandkids have their own lives, especially once they’re adults. If everything has to follow the elders’ say-so, then that’s just a feudal household from the old society…” Zhang Shili’s face darkened. His cane thumped hard on the floor. It was the sign that he was angry. The boy stood up and left, while Zhongshu, hearing the sound, set his phone down, patted his father’s back, and spoke soft words to soothe him."

  china.307.d: "As a rule, the Party has kept a stance both resolute and merciful toward losers in political struggles and former comrades who erred in line: after cutting off their political lives at the root, these aged failures would be left to spend their remaining years quietly in some scenic place under the rubric of “medical parole.” For many former political prisoners, that fate seemed fixed forever—until a recent Central Committee resolution altered the destiny of many of them.\n\nOn the Bohai coast lies Dalian, once the North’s “garden city” and a proud model of urban governance. There, in an unremarked corner, still lived a prisoner. Bo Xilai—former mayor of Dalian and once a member of the Politburo—was watching television. Outside the sanatorium’s walls, the traffic surged; from time to time, whispers of nostalgia drifted for him. But his body, within that comfortable compound, was slowly going to seed.\n\nThe news was enunciating the Party Center’s new policy in a faultless cadence. Bo’s age-spotted hand pressed the rewind key and listened again, then again, then again—until those once-powerful hands trembled, and tears traced the furrows of his old face. I am free, Bo Xilai thought. After more than a decade as a prisoner, he would once more set foot upon this land. Glory and ambition were gone for good, but the fresh air of Dalian had never tasted so sweet."

It seemed that on lands where loess and desert intertwined, the seeds of democracy could not take root—that drifting sands would bury every hope of change. For Wang Yang, however, this inspection tour might be the moment to test the success of his policies.\n\nIn Qinghai, he saw herders break their silence, standing up to offer candid criticisms and suggestions on the pros and cons of policy. In Gansu, he saw farmers shedding old shackles, taking an active part in grassroots local elections. In Xinjiang, he saw the religious rights of Muslims comprehensively guaranteed, with the old shadow swept away.\n\nThe loess was still heavy and cold; the seas of sand still desolate and still. Yet the hope buried deep beneath the dunes would, in the end, bloom."

Wang Yang sat beneath it, an open copy of The Old Regime and the Revolution in his hand, his gaze unfixed, not on the page. He had just finished a day’s work, clearing a mountain of documents, but weariness could not dam the surging of his thoughts. Freedom—two characters like a flame—had burned in his heart for most of a lifetime.\n\nNow, together with the democrats, he had finally broken the cycle of five millennia of autocratic rule, sowing the seeds of freedom in this long-suffering land. The torch of democracy had been lit again, blazing in every citizen’s heart. Yet Wang Yang knew this was only a brief victory. A long road still lay ahead, with barriers to break through, mountains and seas to cross, and the manacles of the old order to shatter. Only thus could the seeds of freedom sprout deep in the people’s hearts and flower in every corner of society.\n\nThe road remained rough, but history’s steps would not halt. Every soul bold enough to challenge the old order would be a star shining along this long march. A China of democracy and freedom would, in the end, break from its chrysalis and rise renewed from the fire."

This report includes their core arguments; for detailed analysis and content, see Appendix No. 106.\n\n“Behind the Communist Party’s ‘equality’ lurks a totalitarian logical paradox: it borrows liberalism’s ideal of universal equality, yet in practice erects a highly totalized social structure. It defines ‘the people’ as mere subjects of obedience, stripping them of the capacity to participate in public affairs. At the same time, the Party concentrates the distribution of privilege and the grip on power in the hands of a few, thereby monopolizing resources and political authority…”\n\n“In the economic realm, state control of resources ought to prevent over-concentration of capital and exploitation, but in practice it has smothered market development under institutional shackles, turning the so-called ‘lifelines of the economy’ into a private preserve for the profit of a tiny few, and depriving private capital of the right to develop freely…”"

Tightening their belts, they resolved to force the crossing. The Chinese opened fire.

Then, en route to the zoo, the motorcade nearly got into an accident at an intersection due to a driver’s error.\n\nOn arrival, the problems continued. Although notified in advance, the staff’s reactions were marked by surprise and confusion. The true tragedy struck while the General Secretary was watching the monkey hill. He appeared to point at a macaque, and for some reason the gesture enraged the animal.\n\nWhether out of revenge or random temper, the monkey hurled a large coconut straight at Hu Chunhua’s head.

It is a feng-shui haven for retiring CCP cadres and social elites from the democratic parties, and a dignified exit ramp—the “desolate lands of Bashan and Chu”—for the losers of political struggle. Under General Secretary Hu Chunhua’s eye, that state of affairs is due for change.\n\nA new intra-Party resolution strongly emphasizes the role of the United Front, fully affirms the CPPCC’s historic contributions, and invests it with great expectations for its mission in future socialist development. This means the CPPCC will be re-empowered and substantially reformed. Its current ‘right to make suggestions’ and ‘right to submit proposals’ will be strengthened into formal participation in the NPC’s legislative power, and experts in the CPPCC will see their advisory role over government work further expanded. The reform calls to mind the direction advanced in the early 2000s by former CPPCC chairman Li Ruihuan, himself of worker background.\n\nThe composition of CPPCC representation will also be improved. The 1990s policy of defining democratic-party recruitment by sector is expected to loosen. Bodies such as the Communist Youth League (from which General Secretary Hu hails), the All-China Federation of Trade Unions representing workers’ interests, and the All-China Women’s Federation will gain greater voice in the CPPCC and, together with a rejuvenated body, take a more active role in politics."

Under his personal care, the CYL Central Committee’s youth work has reached new heights.\n\nWith support from the Party Center, CYL departments have taken active initiative across society. The Juvenile Department has launched the nationwide “I Grow as the Motherland Develops” practical-education campaign, threading labor education into the study and life of primary-school students. On middle- and university-school campuses, the Organization Department’s “Young Marxists Training Program” has not only carried the Party Center’s new line into ideological-political courses and national-defense education, but also vigorously organized young students to take part in labor, teaching support in the countryside, and social volunteer service—aimed at improving ideological and political quality and fostering the comprehensive development and cultivation of youth.\n\nFacing the internet generation, and with the support of the Central Propaganda Department, the “Run the Web for the Whole League, Serve the Whole League” movement has built China Youth Online into a vital ideological position—publicizing to adolescents the Party and state’s major festivals, historic moments, model figures, and heroes; broadly uniting patriotic, pro-Party youth online cultural groups and web workers; and extending the Party’s and the League’s hand into every aspect of youth growth."

  china.667.d: "The scene before him did resemble what he had read in science-fiction novels—the General Secretary thought—though there were differences. For instance, the room housing the super-advanced technological device was not dim at all, but brightly lit by modified, long-chargeable incandescent lamps. Just now he was watching a crew of workers in white coveralls, tense yet unusually silent, using a forklift to raise a massive black module to the set height, preparing to mate it to the giant mainframe before them. The mainframe’s surface was covered with heat-dissipation panels; in the seams, indicator lights and the glint peculiar to data cables flickered. On the platform atop the mainframe, another, older worker was intently monitoring the junction between the two assemblies.\n\nThe General Secretary turned to the chief engineer at his side and asked again, “Are you sure this thing can run to the intended performance and procedures?” All the Politburo members behind them edged closer, trying to catch the exchange. The chief engineer, a man of about forty with thick glasses and a hairline retreating beneath his hard hat, rubbed his stubbled chin for a moment and finally replied: “I can guarantee that for the first three months it will operate flawlessly according to plan.”\n\n“Why only the first three months?” “Because, Comrade Chief, no one can say what it will evolve into after it has taught itself enough data and information…” The General Secretary was about to press further when—click—the final component locked into the mainframe. The workers on site let out a collective breath and then erupted in cheers. The General Secretary, smiling, applauded in celebration; the chief engineer and the Politburo members followed suit."
  china.668.t: "Descent"
  china.668.d: "It looked like just another ordinary day in the People’s Republic of China. The borderlands were calm; instructions from higher-ups and the center were being transmitted in tidy sequence. Aircraft patrolling the skies and warships roaming the seas executed their tasks to the letter. From the snowy Northeast to the mist-wreathed southern marches, highways, railways, and air routes were as busy as ever—traffic streaming, planes lifting and landing, bullet trains flashing past. Yet neither mayors, ministers, nor directors—nor even the General Secretary himself—had handled these orders. Government departments received detailed, up-to-the-minute information every day, along with policy directives long since planned: from the optimal daily caloric intake for citizens of a ten-million-strong metropolis, to the latest throughput on a state agrarian combine’s food line, to the current cargo tonnage at Yangshan Deep-Water Port, and the magnitude of the renminbi’s exchange-rate movement in the past hour.\n\nAll of this owed to the giant mainframe at Chongqing University’s Liangjiang Campus. In the past three months, the supercomputer—already christened “Long March”—had burst past every wild imagining. At the outset it required constant bureaucratic oversight and maintenance by researchers; now the blue points of light on its surface flashed ceaselessly, showing it capable of autonomous computation and analysis. As more and more subsidiary nodes came online across the country, torrents of data from everywhere—including surveillance cameras and internet terminals—poured in automatically, and after complex processes of self-learning and processing, were transmitted as precise conclusions.\n\nConsidering that “Long March” in effect collects all valuable information within China and real-time reflections of thought, speech, and behavior, one might say that, for the first time in history, the collective will of the Chinese people is truly governing the country. For a people being ruled by a computer, the Chinese have been calm—many even praise the administrative efficiency and fairness that “Long March” has brought. Perhaps that, too, is a form of Chinese pragmatism. In laboratories nationwide—including the institute housing the mainframe—the crowds coming to visit “Long March” grow by the day. Many, faces alight with admiration, cross the skybridge past the glass room that holds the supercomputer, clicking their tongues in wonder."

We have reason to believe that escalating political extremism and deepening social division in the United States will further jeopardize its national stability and profoundly undermine the continuity of its domestic and foreign policies as well as the effectiveness of implementation.\n\nAs the U.S. presidential election approaches, contradictions between the populist political camp centered on President Donald Trump and the anti-Trump political alliance are entering a stage of final showdown. Interwoven factors—including the China–U.S. trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic—have steadily increased the size of groups deeply dissatisfied with the Trump administration, among them both radical left and extreme right forces. Meanwhile, on the other side, pro-Trump mobilization has grown more active, and violent clashes are becoming more common.\n\nThis once again demonstrates the foresight of your judgment that “the world is undergoing changes unseen in a century.” Synthesizing the relevant intelligence, the MSS recommends that the CPC Central Committee and the Central People’s Government continue to maintain close attention and prepare for a higher probability of additional black-swan events.\n\nRespectfully,\nSalute"

The disintegration of the United States is now a fait accompli; violent conflict has escalated into multi-sided warfare among political factions. The MSS herewith submits a brief to the Politburo summarizing the reports concerned.\n\nFirst are the forces composed of the principal groupings within the two erstwhile ruling parties—represented chiefly by the constitutionalist faction led by Donald Trump and the coalition government led by Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. Trump and his supporters are gradually withdrawing to Denver, Colorado, standing in opposition to the Biden camp on the East Coast. We assess that warfare between these two poles will form the main axis of the U.S. civil strife to come.\n\nNext are various separatist forces arising from grassroots political movements, foremost among them the Patriot Front in New England. They espouse populist and nationalist ideas even more radical than those of the Trump faction and can broadly be categorized as neo-fascist. At the same time, the activities of yet more extreme Nazi organizations and other alt-right groups cannot be ignored.\n\nNotably, multiple left-wing forces have risen on the West Coast—especially in California—including several local parties openly espousing socialism. It is believed they have begun discussing the possibility of forming a united front and are firming their path toward armed revolutionary struggle in the United States. This change may portend a future socialist revolution in America. However uncertain its prospects, it remains a significant favorable development for our country.\n\nRespectfully,\nSalute"

The victor that still stood after the trial by fire—unsurprisingly, the People’s Republic of China—earned the right to shape a new order.\n\nChina’s irresistible rise has become the nightmare of her foes. They remember well the crimes they once committed against her and, in fear of the reckoning to come, have slid into madness. Their struggles as cornered beasts killed thousands upon thousands; the blood of their people was spilled without pity in deranged schemes to put the Chinese people to the sword. Such crimes demand the judgment of justice.\n\nEven under encirclement by reactionary forces and amid the eruption of problems left from the period of high-speed development, the vast power released by China’s unity broke through every obstacle. The People’s Liberation Army extended its legend of invincibility, winning unprecedented victories in two information-age wars and in multiple disaster-relief operations. With labor and ingenuity, the Chinese people built the Republic into the world’s most prosperous, affluent, and green country in the Fourth Industrial Revolution; a new distribution system ensured that prosperity reached all. Through the tireless efforts of our researchers, we ceaselessly expanded humanity’s frontier—in thought and in space. With the might of information technology and the oversight of the people, we won a phase victory over corruption and inefficiency; professional decision-making and democratic supervision were fused at every node of national governance. At this juncture, with the twenty-first century nearly half gone, we have realized the dreams of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Comrade Mao Zedong: a rich, strong, democratic, civilized, and harmonious People’s China—independent and self-reliant—stands in the East.\n\nBut, dear player, the great endeavor of the Chinese nation is far from done. Though the Asian War of Liberation has ended, the peoples of the former NATO countries still struggle amid the ruins. With America’s reunification, the shadow of a trans-Pacific Cold War returns. Russia to our north offers words but scant deeds, and malignant anti-Asian discrimination has surged within its borders. Nor are we ourselves perfect: despite material abundance, involution and spiritual burnout still entangle our society…\n\nOn history’s eternal Long March, the ordinary yet great Chinese people sow hope and till the soil with their hands and minds, advancing—steadfastly, step by step—toward new horizons.\n\nRested enough?

Read this passage: Democracy is a political system in which the people participate and decide; its core is ‘popular sovereignty,’ meaning that the state’s power derives from the people, and government exists to better serve and represent the people’s interests. Under a democratic system, every citizen has the right to criticize and make suggestions regarding government policy and behavior, fostering plural public discussion that pushes government to improve governance and safeguard fairness and justice.”\n\nHe paused, looked over the students, and asked: “Do you know what real democracy is?”\n\nSilence. The students looked at each other. Their textbooks had never probed the topic in depth; often teachers did not ask their opinions at all, but merely told them which points would be on the exam. So when the old teacher asked now, not one could answer.\n\n“Democracy is not only a system; it is a way of life and a set of values. It means respect, inclusion, equality, and freedom. It means everyone has the right to pursue happiness, and everyone has the responsibility to consider others.”\n\nA student raised a hand: “Teacher, if, in a family, parents implemented democracy the way a state does—what would that look like?”"

He had thought of appealing, of resistance; but before the mighty machine of power, he felt like an insect trapped in a spider’s web—the more he struggled, the deeper the despair.\n\nToday, he discovered his Weibo account unexpectedly unblocked. No notice, no explanation—sudden and inscrutable, just like the ban back then. He did not know what it meant: to inspire grateful obedience, or to bait him into repeating the past? He hesitated for a long time, then at last summoned the courage to log in.

Everyone knew it would pass; before the meeting it had been settled. For Zhong, who ran factories, the draft would only cut into profits—but for appearances’ sake he raised his hand anyway. Jiang Shiyuan, diagonally behind him, furrowed his brow, eyes fixed on the text; his fingers tapped lightly on the desk, as if turning something over.\n\n“All opposed, raise your hand.”\n\nSilence.\n\nThen Jiang slowly raised his right hand.

  china.403.d: "Zou Yubing walked along the crowded sidewalk. Today was the day of Taiyuan’s mayoral election. Slogans were pasted up along the street; loudspeakers looped campaign catchphrases. Zou had no interest in any of it. He only wanted to hurry to the nearest polling place, perform what he saw as a meaningless ritual, and then go home for a bowl of noodles his wife was making. At a crossroads he stopped, looking around in boredom. Across the road, a cluster of seniors in red vests were enthusiastically handing out flyers to passersby.\n\nWhen the light turned green, Zou strode across the street and reached the gate of his housing compound, where a temporary polling station had been set up. A few tables had been shoved together under a canopy; on top sat the ballot box and stacks of ballots. Several staffers, bored, sat behind the tables. Zou stepped into the tent and handed over his ID card. Barely glancing at it, the staffer asked without looking up, “Who are you voting for?”\n\nZou picked up a ballot and skimmed the placards for the candidates—unfamiliar faces, with nothing but names, brief résumés, and a set of governing platforms he’d never seen before. He casually ticked a box beside a name, slipped the ballot into the box, turned, and left—the whole process felt like completing an inconsequential task.\n\nOutside, he let out a long breath, as if he had finished a heavy chore and felt light again. He looked up at the gray sky and thought: It’s all the same whoever wins. Officials are in it for themselves—who really cares about ordinary people’s lives?\n\nWith that, he quickened his pace toward home."

  china.404.t: "Media Thaw"
  china.404.d: "In the men’s dorm at Henan University of Technology, Chen Fanwei shot upright in bed. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he found the room empty; only the glare of sunlight through the window told him it was late.\n\n“Damn, overslept again!” he swore, grabbing his phone. It read 11:38—he suddenly remembered he had Ideological and Moral Cultivation and Rule of Law that morning.\n\n“Forget it. The old professor’s lectures put me to sleep anyway.”\n\nHe consoled himself and tapped open a video app to scroll short videos and unwind. But the instant the app opened, he froze. The familiar home-page recommendations looked different. Creators who should only appear on YouTube were suddenly showing up, and video-makers long banned on the Chinese internet—game streamers included—now had their videos available domestically.\n\nThen he saw that face he’d only ever seen on YouTube: Wang Zhian. Chen drew a sharp breath; his mind went blank."

  china.405.t: "In Memory of 1989"
  china.405.d: "Beijing, Zhongshan Park. A candlelight vigil drew minds back to 1989. Members of the long-watched and long-prohibited “Tiananmen Mothers” reappeared, holding the mainland’s first public commemoration for the June Fourth victims in more than thirty years—right in the heart of China, a wall away from the Forbidden City and steps from Chang’an Avenue, where tanks once rumbled past. The movement’s long-missing leader, former professor Ding Zilin, delivered a speech calling the night a milestone and expressing confidence that in a future China, vindication for the victims of 1989 and rights-advocacy by their families would make greater headway.\n\nIt is inconceivable that the “Tiananmen Mothers” acted without at least tacit government consent. Though official newspapers, news channels, and public accounts stayed silent, videos from the vigil—shot by netizens—spread widely and stirred debate. Opinion-makers touting “patriotism” condemned the event as an insult to the Party, the state, and the army—a self-demolition of the ideological Great Wall. More ordinary people, however, responded with tolerance and cautious support—understandable, since the June Fourth incident remains officially labeled a “riot.” Enough generations have grown up since 1989 that its political impact on the public has greatly faded. Many argue that instead of keeping it taboo, an open stance may be the best way to resolve old grievances."

  china.314.t: "An Age of Electric Cars?"
  china.314.d: "As the oil crisis’s drag on our economy gradually eased, many people rolled their Volkswagens and Audis back out of the garage, filled the tanks, and hit the expressways again. Drivers, however, may be puzzled that the expected scene—gas stations jammed and shouts of “Fill with 94!” “Fill with 96!”—never materialized. The reason is visible in the lively traffic all around: the green plates of new-energy vehicles everywhere.\n\nThe oil crisis hammered China’s traditional auto industry, yet pressed fast-forward for NEVs. Led by BYD, with NIO and XPeng close behind, new firms dove into this unexpectedly opened blue ocean. On the strength of years of technical accumulation and favorable policy, these companies—founded mostly by young entrepreneurs—captured half the Chinese auto market in short order, while exporting product overseas. Foreign competitors who long derided Chinese cars as inferior knockoffs were stunned to find China swallowing a large chunk of their traditional markets—and the quality now worlds apart from the past."

  china.315.t: "Wave of Attacks on Foreigners Inside China"
  china.315.d: "Recently, multiple attacks against Japanese citizens and other foreigners occurred across China, drawing broad international attention. Reports indicate incidents mainly in coastal cities and some inland provinces, involving tourists, businesspeople, and students. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the Chinese government takes these cases very seriously, has ordered relevant departments to investigate, and will punish perpetrators according to law. The spokesperson emphasized China’s consistent commitment to safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of foreign nationals in China and to taking all necessary measures to ensure their safety and personal freedom.\n\nJapan has lodged a protest requesting stronger protection for its citizens. Australia, South Korea, Indonesia, and others voiced concern and advised their nationals in China to exercise caution. Some analysts link the incidents to tense China–Japan relations and prejudice against foreigners among some Chinese; others suggest that certain groups or individuals are stoking nationalist sentiment behind the scenes.\n\nPolice have opened investigations and detained some suspects. The government says security has been reinforced at venues frequented by foreigners. The situation bears close watching."

  china.316.t: "A New Narrative for The Three-Body Problem"
  china.316.d: "As part of united-front propaganda during the U.S. civil war, the People’s Liberation Army of America released a new film via channels it controls and online streaming. Unexpectedly, the film adapts Chinese author Liu Cixin’s science-fiction trilogy The Three-Body Problem, which won the Hugo Award in 2015 and drew praise from figures such as Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, and George R. R. Martin.\n\nThe film makes tweaks for American tastes, adding more diverse characters and reducing the number of principal Chinese roles (a move reportedly pilloried by Chinese purists). Overall it preserves the core ideas of the original while serving the PLA(A)’s propaganda ends. In the film, a commander—clearly a traditional WASP-elite type and a former Marine—peels his warship away from the fleet and thus escapes destruction by an alien super-weapon. But by sacrificing comrades and winnowing “doomsday elites” through brutal struggle, he earns the betrayal that kills him. Elsewhere, a former physician turned politician—played by an Indian–Black actress, with obvious referents—wins the youth by preaching “love” and “joy” in the post-deterrence era to become Earth’s leader, only for her weakness to open the door to alien invasion.\n\nReleased, the film sparked wide discussion. Beyond admiration for its astonishing VFX achieved in wartime, many focused on its obvious political allegory, generating a spectrum of interpretations."

  china.317.t: "Agricultural Bank Crisis"
  china.317.d: "In Henan Province, four rural banks abruptly and without warning shut down online withdrawals and transfers at nearly the same time. Numerous depositors consequently faced difficulties accessing funds, and the news—and the panic it spawned—spread rapidly. The authorities took notice. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission ordered local offices to coordinate with governments and relevant departments to investigate promptly and handle matters properly. At present, deposit services at the affected rural banks’ branches are operating normally under legal protection."

  china.318.d: "After official adjustments to real-estate policies, Evergrande Group proved unable to adapt to the new market environment; the massive debts accrued over years of operation became the mountain that crushed it. Although Evergrande attempted proactive measures to address its debt risks, tightening liquidity across numerous financial institutions made the problem ever more acute. In the end, Evergrande Real Estate Group came under investigation, and Hui Ka Yan, on suspicion of illegal crimes, was placed under compulsory measures by police in accordance with the law."

Given the shocking incidents during the recent social unrest in Hong Kong—including brazen arson attacks before media cameras—the anger of people in both the mainland and Hong Kong helped pave the way for the law’s smooth passage to sanction such destructive acts."

The report noted that, under the current moderately prosperous standard, all 98.99 million rural poor were lifted out of poverty, all 832 impoverished counties shed their labels, and all 128,000 poor villages were removed from the rolls—resolving regional, systemic poverty in China."

  china.324.d: "Driven by global supply–demand imbalances from the COVID-19 pandemic, rising raw-material costs, and China’s push to steer the economy in a “greener direction,” multiple regions of the country experienced power shortages, prompting local governments to introduce rationing policies.

  china.1016.t: "When That Day Comes"
  china.1016.d: "The smell of smoke had yet to dissipate, and the sea wind already carried a strange briny tang—a breath from another hemisphere, metallic and nauseating with invasion. That scent now brooded over the Taiwan Strait, like the hulking forms plowing its waters—the joint fleet of the Royal Australian Navy and Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force. Huang Zeyang gripped the rail till his knuckles blanched. Such a sight—foreign forces wantonly traversing China’s seas—should never have happened, yet now unfolded before his eyes, moment by moment.\n\n“All of it’s goddamn fake…” he muttered between clenched teeth. Humiliation and rage boiled within him like magma, searing his innards. If only this were a nightmare, and waking he would still be the soldier guarding the motherland’s coasts—not a defeated man, a captive in chains. But he knew this was no dream. The PLA’s defeat in the bid to liberate Taiwan was real; the dying screams of his comrades were real; the soldiers lying forever in the Strait were real…\n\nHe hated—the invaders, the traitors, and most of all himself: powerless to change anything. He yearned to take up arms and fight to the death against those who invaded—even to fall on the field of battle would be better than this wretched survival. But he knew he could do nothing now. The only thing left was to wait—for a chance, a chance for revenge."

  china.1017.t: "Night Talk"
  china.1017.d: "Since taking up posts in Fujian, Xi Jinping had gradually kicked his smoking habit. After becoming General Secretary, his personal physician kept constant watch, and even staff in the General Secretary’s office dared not keep an ashtray at hand. Today, though, Xi decided to break a routine he had followed for more than thirty years.\n\nIt was late at night in Qinzheng Hall, Zhongnanhai; only a desk lamp cast a warm, yellow glow. Xi drew a crumpled pack of Lotus-brand cigarettes from the pocket of his suit, pulled one out, and tossed the pack to the retired vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Youxia, seated across the table. After a quiet spell of smoke curling and dissipating, Xi suddenly broke the silence: “Tell me—who should take over?”\n\nThe army general’s hand paused over his ash, and through the smoke he looked at his old comrade, arranging his face into timely puzzlement and incredulity. Xi gave a wry smile and pressed: “Do you think I can be chairman for life?”\n\nZhang’s mind began to race. Names of the Party’s so-called “successors” flashed through his head: Gao Gang, Liu Shaoqi, Wang Hongwen, Hua Guofeng, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, Sun Zhengcai… Those who prophesy the future succession of supreme power never meet a good end; whether in ancient dynasties or socialist states, this is a constant of human society. Zhang spread his hands and parried his leader with ambiguity: “Whomever is finally chosen, I will support the Central Committee’s decision…” Xi raised the subject no further, smoking on in silence."

  china.2001.d: "When the smoke thinned, Asia—long scourged and ravaged—at last knew a silence it had forgotten. The Chinese nation’s dream of revival, long dormant, glimpsed the first light of dawn through baptism by blood and fire.\n\nThe Western world cast China’s loss in the Taiwan Strait as a replay of the “Sick Man of East Asia,” hoping to finish the story with jeers. Yet history does not judge heroes by victory or defeat. The bitter setback did not crush the Chinese nation; it drove an unprecedented revival to a crest, tempering the red dragon in a blaze woven from fury and pain—harder, stronger, thirsting to wash away a century of national calamity and humiliation in blood.\n\nLike King Goujian lying on firewood and tasting gall before destroying Wu, the dragon, brimming with wrath, set the Pacific aflame, proclaiming to all beneath heaven—it never submitted, never died. Upon a throne forged of blood and bone, the Chinese nation asserted—beyond dispute—its paramount place as East Asia’s hegemon. Every imperialist force that sought to strangle it became a corpse beneath its iron tread.\n\nFacts proved that the Chinese nation is more fit than any to lead all the peoples of Asia. Without China there is no ancient culture of the East; without China there is no reborn Asia of today. Since antiquity, the Chinese nation has stood above all others.\n\nDear player—perhaps the loss in the Strait once filled you with anger and grief. But now you have erased a hundred years of shame from China’s pages and opened a more brilliant age for this land. Our salute to you! And yet the dragon’s journey is not done; in the years to come it will press on toward more distant horizons."

Yet history does not judge heroes by victory or defeat. The bitter setback did not crush the Chinese people; it drove an unprecedented democratic movement to a crest. The people shattered autocracy’s shackles and welcomed a spring of democracy—but that does not mean the crimes of imperialism are forgiven.\n\nThe dragon, wrapped in righteous fury, lit the Pacific, its towering flames proclaiming on all sides—never did it submit, nor vanish into the dust of history. With fourteen hundred million at its back, it asserted—beyond dispute—its place as East Asia’s “beacon of democracy.” United, the Chinese people shattered every imperialist attempt to throttle the dragon and liberated Asian peoples ensnared and enslaved by the sham “democracy” of Western imperialism.\n\nNever has Asia been so united; under the dragon’s lead it strides toward a shining new millennium. History’s wheel rolls over old scars and hatreds; souls tempered by suffering find new rebirth in the fire.\n\nDear player—perhaps the loss in the Strait once filled you with anger and grief. But now you have wiped a century of shame from China’s pages and let the flower of freedom blossom on this ancient soil. Our salute to you!

Yet history does not judge heroes by victory or defeat. The bitter setback did not crush the Chinese nation; it drove an unprecedented red revolutionary movement to a crest, and in the tempests of a troubled age the Chinese people struck up an undying crimson symphony.\n\nToday’s China is as in the decades after Liberation, when, under Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China fought through perils to break imperialism’s ring. Now all Asia stands astonished by the onrushing storm of revolution; the roar of the proletariat rends the chains of imperialism and capitalism, hauling the oppressed toilers up from the abyss.\n\nFrom the East a crimson flame billows, burning away the dregs and fetters of the past and reducing all that is rotten to ash. Wherever the blaze reaches, its fierce light sweeps the lands once shadowed by gloom, gilding this ancient earth with a red radiance.\n\nDear player—perhaps the loss in the Strait once filled you with anger and grief. But now you have erased a century of shame from China’s pages—the red sun of the East is rising. Our salute to you!

Nearly all the villagers stood at the entrance to the village, gazing silently toward the road in the distance. The plaque over the village committee’s gate had been covered with a banner reading in great characters, “Welcome Home, Special-Class Meritorious Hero.” Yet there was no festive air to greet a hero—on the contrary, a heavy mood was spreading.\n\nA mighty People’s Liberation Army procession drew near, washing the little village on the great plain in army green. On every face was a solemn, grave expression. At the head marched two senior colonels with armbands of the CMC Political Work Department. Behind them came three honor guards: the two on either side bore the national flag and the army flag; the soldier in the center cradled a rosewood urn, upon which rested a soldier’s cap.\n\n“Fellow villagers, the People’s Liberation Army now delivers to you the ashes of Martyr Zhang Boyang,” the leading officer said, his tone heavy. People parted to open a path. An elderly woman—white-haired, stooped—advanced slowly, supported by cadres of the village committee and the most respected elders. With only a few steps left, she could endure no more and threw herself upon the urn. Great beads of grief rolled down her deeply lined cheeks as she murmured—"

We have reason to believe that the current severity of the Taiwan Strait situation has surpassed the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis of 2022; it can be regarded that a Fifth Taiwan Strait Crisis has already broken out, and the opportunity to liberate Taiwan has reappeared.\n\nBy cross-validating imagery captured by high-speed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft with reports from clandestine assets within Taiwan’s armed forces, we have obtained PDTO’s concrete deployments on the island. The alliance’s principal air power is housed in the bunkers of Jiashan Air Base, Hualien, on Taiwan’s east coast—within a dead angle of our fires—posing a grave threat to our landing forces and forward fleets. At the same time, photos taken by pro-mainland residents on the island confirm that PDTO has deployed large ground forces at two potential northern landing sites—the Tamsui River estuary and Hsinchu—to counter a possible amphibious assault by our forces.\n\nSynthesizing the relevant intelligence, the MSS recommends that the Central Military Commission and the Central People’s Government maintain the highest alert and prepare to respond to the inevitable PDTO counterblows during the liberation of Taiwan.\n\nRespectfully,\nSalute"

We have reason to believe that India is engaging with the so-called “Pacific Defense Treaty Organization” and is continually stoking tensions in the India–Pakistan dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nMeanwhile, a sudden exchange of fire has occurred between Indian and Pakistani forces along the Kashmir frontier. Pakistan claims a drone attempted to intrude into its airspace for reconnaissance and was shot down by Pakistani troops. To cover up the intrusion, Indian forces allegedly raked Pakistani posts along the Sialkot border with gunfire.\n\nIndia, for its part, accuses Pakistan of firing first, asserting that Pakistani troops opened fire without cause at Indian posts on the Jammu border during the night; India’s attack on Pakistani positions, it says, was an “appropriate retaliation.” The clash reportedly left at least three Indian soldiers wounded and forced the emergency evacuation of dozens of villagers.\n\nSynthesizing the relevant intelligence, the MSS assesses that rising tensions in Jammu and Kashmir could precipitate a Fourth Indo-Pak War.

  china.327.d: "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  $PRC_MSS_leader_texticon$  \n\n\n\n\nRespected Comrade Chairman:\n\nIn accordance with your orders, the Ministry of State Security has collected and analyzed intelligence on the deployment and activity tracks of recent JMSDF vessels. We have reason to believe the JMSDF is engaged in abnormal deployments in waters near our country.\n\nIn recent days our navy has carried out a three-day mission in waters off Ningbo to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. The Zhejiang Maritime Safety Administration issued advance notices prohibiting unrelated vessels from entering. That same day, without notification, the JMSDF destroyer Suzutsuki intruded into China’s territorial sea off Zhejiang and loitered. Our navy issued stern radio warnings demanding disclosure of purpose and immediate departure, but the vessel failed to respond, ignored our territorial sovereignty, and continued accelerating within our waters. Our warships ultimately cut across her course, forcing her to alter heading and return to the high seas. Subsequent verification shows Suzutsuki departed Sasebo the previous day and entered our territorial seas the next to reconnoiter our operations.\n\nSynthesizing the relevant intelligence, the MSS recommends that the Party Central Committee and the Central People’s Government maintain high alert and prepare for further anomalous JMSDF movements—and even the possibility of interference in our internal affairs.\n\nRespectfully,\nSalute"

We have reason to believe that Japan and Australia have formed a political-economic-military alliance—the so-called Pacific Defense Treaty Organization (PDTO)—and are seeking to draw Southeast Asian countries and India into it.\n\nOur assets in New Delhi report that Prime Minister Modi has shown strong interest in joining the PDTO and that India and Bangladesh are discussing partnership arrangements. At the same time, personnel of Japanese and Australian embassies/consulates and affiliated businesspeople are lobbying across Southeast Asia, trading political favors to woo former ASEAN states into the bloc. Friends in those countries tell us these efforts are explicitly exclusionary toward China and have asked that their communications to us remain confidential.\n\nSynthesizing the relevant intelligence, the MSS assesses that the PDTO is a military alliance established by Japan and Australia to enact strategic encirclement of our country. We recommend that the Party Center and the Central People’s Government remain highly vigilant and prepare for the risk that Southeast Asian states and India join the PDTO to tighten a ring around us.\n\nRespectfully,\nSalute"

  china.330.t: "Setting Course for the Sea of Stars"
  china.330.d: "“Given America’s full-blown civil war and the general decline of aerospace capabilities in Europe and Russia, our country is now the world’s premier space power.” The chairman of CASIC set the tone at a meeting that would decide the future of China’s space endeavor. The room fell silent; a sense of disorientation spread.\n\nFor years, China trailed the United States in space. Now, many of NASA’s and SpaceX’s top technical talents have fled to China for safety. A burden too great, too soon, has been set upon China’s shoulders—can it truly lead humanity into space? A more worrisome question lurks: with no peer competitors left, does China’s space sector still merit investment on its former scale? NASA faced a similar quandary after the Soviet collapse; funding plunged, and the agency bade a long farewell to its golden age. Will CNSA meet the same fate?\n\nChina’s space community chose to answer with deeds. Despite the oil shock and global financial crisis, our space program kept existing plans on track. Far from tightening the purse strings after America’s collapse, the Center committed more real resources. Like a Noah’s Ark towering in a world-flood, China’s space program has taken in all who still dare to dream, bearing the ancient human longing to look up at the stars."

  china.331.t: "The Return of “Judicial Web”"
  china.331.d: "Years ago, the “Judicial Web”—a portal enabling the public to follow case progress and the workings of the courts—was hailed as a key window for transparency and openness in China’s judicial system. Under Xi Jinping, however, its transparency ebbed as part of a consolidation of administrative and judicial power, to the dismay of domestic democrats.\n\nWith the leadership transition, the site now has a chance at rebirth. With General Secretary Wang’s support, Zhou Qiang, Secretary of the Central Political-Legal Affairs Commission, has ordered the platform restored and further strengthened. In the future, the public will not only be able to view public case files online; case proceedings, hearing records, and related materials will also be accessible on the site.\n\nAs the vanguard reform in a system long seen as opaque and forbidding, Zhou’s step has cheered democrats and marks China’s judicial enterprise’s steady return from the black box to the light of day."

When we were fighting Japan he was flying drones over Fukuoka!”\n\n“Hey, Old Wang, now that we’ve taken Japan, shouldn’t we give America a thrashing too?”\n\n“Too right. Those Yankee devils, those Russian muzhiks—both need a lesson. Right, Brother Xu?”\n\n“Mm… I don’t think they’ll want another war. And there’s trade ties…”\n\n“To hell with it—drink!”\n\nThe banquet rolled on past midnight as the young men argued their points. They staggered out arm in arm; someone vomited on the pavement while the more sober patted backs in consolation. They hugged their goodbyes on a near-empty street.

  china.334.d: "Since civil war in Saudi Arabia ignited the oil crisis, many nations have schemed to carve gains from that land. But the death-game of politicians and zealots is a nightmare for ordinary people. Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced since the war began, yet the states behind the factions keep placing bets.\n\nMost foreigners have left the trouble-torn land. But sometimes leaving is not so easy. A Xinhua reporter, determined to record a few days more, lost contact with home—and for a time his fate was unknown. After a long silence, a video appeared on social media: he was at Tehran International Airport, preparing to fly home.\n\nA reporter ought to mind his appearance, to tidy himself before the camera; instead, he was unkempt, the whites of his eyes veined with red, his speech disordered. The numb set of his mouth and the before-and-after contrast forced the question of what horrors this luckless Chinese journalist had endured. Some called him China’s Lawrence; others asked whether any of it was worth it."

  china.335.d: "“Let me reiterate: the Party and the state guarantee that patriotic entrepreneurs may still travel freely across the Strait for business. The Special Administrative Regions’ systems will remain unchanged for fifty years—please rest assured.”\n\nAt the United Front consultation, a businessman invited to attend sat below the rostrum while a senior official—one of those sent to take over and rebuild governance in Taiwan—warmly assured Taiwan’s merchants that the Chinese government would respect their property and commercial activity.\n\nOutside the hall, another entrepreneur who had not been invited paced back and forth in the lounge. As soon as the official finished his remarks and entered, the man stepped forward to ask: “Sir, I want to attend this consultation too. Why wasn’t I invited? I see someone inside who used to bankroll the DPP. How come he gets to be there?”\n\nThe official took a drink of water and replied unhurriedly, “I’ve spoken with him. And he is patriotic.” With that, he turned to head back into the venue. The entrepreneur gritted his teeth and followed after him:"

  china.336.d: "On a clear Taipei night, the gentle evening breeze could lift anyone’s spirits. Though the PLA had taken over the city, Taipei residents tried to keep to their ordinary routines in the calm after the fighting.\n\nMr. Lin lived with his wife, daughter, and aged mother on Heping East Road. Prices had risen under military control—inevitable—but he still had his job and decent savings; maintaining their standard of living was not a problem. With fine weather on the weekend, shops that had shuttered during the initial battles were reopening one by one; a few, for various reasons, had been sealed—some for ties to cults, others for links to gangs. The soldiers on street duty kept good discipline and were not a frightening presence. Word was that the old shop selling pork thick soup had reopened yesterday, so Mr. Lin decided to take the whole family downstairs for a proper meal.\n\nAfter that long-missed taste of the old days, they started home. But at the entrance to their housing compound they found engineers and police stringing barbed wire and erecting a metal turnstile gate. Mr. Lin’s family were not the only ones startled—neighbors coming and going wore the same look. Clearly another gang or cult hideout had been uncovered. Loudspeakers were broadcasting a new notice from the control authorities—because a large number of serious criminals had been found in the vicinity, and to ensure residents’ safety during complete eradication operations, a curfew would be enforced from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.; entry and exit would still require ID scans; anyone needing to go out during curfew for special reasons must register in advance and seek assistance from personnel on duty…\n\nGangs and cults—filth with deep roots. It wouldn’t be quick to deal with, but surely not too slow either. Mr. Lin gave his daughter’s hand a gentle tug, and they passed through the turnstile to go home."

  china.337.t: "The Last Revolutionary Bastion"
  china.337.d: "Years ago, when China’s revolution ebbed, some asked in despair: “How long can the red flag still fly?” Our great leader Mao Zedong answered: “A single spark can start a prairie fire.” Even when the Red Army was forced back by the reactionaries, the people’s support and the guiding light of communist ideals let it rise from the flames again and again—stronger each time—until it defeated the bourgeois tyrants and imperialist compradors.\n\nLooking back, we seem to have trod a road that rhymes with that past. Many condemn the retrograde policies of Xi’s rule for inflicting grievous harm on China’s people; yet if we trace the root, the seed was sown in the Deng era. Deng’s slogan of “taking economic development as the central task” cleverly beguiled the majority, draining courage and conviction until people became walking dead ruled by mammon and cynicism. Worse, China’s abrupt turn struck at revolutionary movements across the Asia–Pacific, inflicting irreparable damage and reducing them to near-irrelevance for forty years.\n\nTimes and fate now grant us a chance to reverse the tide. This time, we will not take for granted the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions. This time, we will not ignore the outstretched hands of oppressed comrades across Asia. In Tiananmen Square we swear solemnly to Chairman Mao: bringing down the reactionary regime on Taiwan Island is only the beginning…"

  china.338.d: "Night pressed low over Manama; the city, like a sleeping giant, breathed slow and steady in the dark. In a room of the Carlton Hotel, however, the air was different—taut with anxiety. The diplomatic representative of the Arab Royal Alliance paced ceaselessly, thoughts in disarray.\n\nSince the civil war’s outbreak, the Alliance had found it lacked broad support. If they could not win, the end awaiting them might be a fate worse than death. That is why he was in Bahrain: to find, at any cost, a country willing to back them. Hours earlier, he had met Chinese diplomats in secret here, seeking China’s support. If Beijing would extend a hand to help the Alliance depose the king, they would secure Saudi Arabia’s future oil in a steady stream.\n\nThe Chinese diplomats kept straight faces, but he could tell his proposal had struck a chord. They were weighing gains and losses, calculating the risks and rewards of this high-stakes gamble. “We need time to consider,” they finally said. And so he waited—waited for their answer, for the verdict that might decide his own fate and that of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMinutes crept by; the air seemed to congeal. He drew back the heavy curtains and stared at a sky on the verge of dawn. Then the telephone rang, shattering the stillness. His heart lurched. He strode to the desk, drew a deep breath to steady himself, and lifted the receiver.\n\n“Esteemed representative of the Royal Alliance, we are prepared to pursue in-depth cooperation with your side.”"

  china.339.d: "The Pacific breeze, warm with California’s signature softness, brushed Monterey’s sands. Far off, a few gulls traced lazy circles in the sky.\n\nCloser in, landing craft broke the surf with a low roar, ferrying a contingent of PLA troops onto this unfamiliar shore. Ma Yilong stood on the beach, a cigarette between his lips and a map in hand. Peering past the wind toward a strand that until recently had belonged to the so-called “United States of America,” he couldn’t help but smile. “A few years ago I had to buy a plane ticket and pinch my nose for those insufferably haughty customs officers. Funny—this time they invited us.”\n\nA soldier ran up, travel-worn but brisk, snapped a salute, and reported: “Comrade Brigade Commander, the advance elements have reached their designated points and can commence operations at any time!”\n\nMa drew hard on his cigarette, narrowed his eyes, and ground the butt into the fine sand underfoot. “Notify all regiments: heads up and stay sharp! We’re here to help the American people, not to swagger. Remember—discipline is a mountain. Anyone who breaks it can enjoy the graveyard shift tonight!”"
  china.339.a: "“Yes, sir!”"
  china.340.t: "Revising the Principles of Reform and Opening-Up"
  china.340.d: "For decades, Deng Xiaoping’s reform measures were taken as “remarkably effective,” credited with steering China out of past disorder into modernization and forging an economic miracle that astonished the world—from land reform to Special Economic Zones to SOE restructuring. A new China lurched forward through storm and stress. Rapid growth and rising living standards, however, papered over a multitude of ills: staggering corruption and stratified society among them. Bureaucratic capital tightened its cruel exploitation of the masses—using the household-registration system to ration welfare, constricting land supply and driving up housing costs, gorging on monetary expansion and finance that flouted market discipline—until every last coin of the people was consumed.\n\nWe cannot let such errors continue. The people must enjoy the fruits of their labor—rather than toil day in and day out to mint profits for bureaucrats and capitalists. We will rebuild household consumption and welfare systems, control leverage, and reduce dependence on external exports and excess savings so that the many can share in development’s gains. The people’s power will be guaranteed by crucial laws and organizations; diverse, freely formed mutual-aid bodies of working people will help them resist possible oppression and exploitation. A market economy that aims to strip the vast majority of their freedom will be thoroughly reformed; a democratized government will actively intervene to uphold social equality and justice."

  china.341.t: "The Trial"
  china.341.d: "Cao Dewang—once the glass king—now stood in the dock. Stooped, hair matted to his brow, his clouded eyes brimmed with fatigue and despair.\n\n“Defendant Cao Dewang, as founder of Fuyao Glass Group, you ignored laws and regulations, showed contempt for the rights of laborers, and for years subjected workers to brutal exploitation. Your conduct constitutes…”\n\nThe judge’s voice rang in the courtroom, but Cao no longer heard the litany of crimes. He had thought money could buy everything—including workers’ dignity and freedom. He was wrong—grievously wrong.\n\n“Pursuant to Articles 244, 248, and 276 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, the court sentences the defendant Cao Dewang to life imprisonment and orders the confiscation of all personal assets…”\n\nCao’s legs buckled, but the bailiffs held him fast in their cuffs. His lips trembled without sound as he watched the gavel fall. Shuffled from the dock, he moved like a man aged decades in an instant. He glanced back at the workers in the gallery—faces etched with fury and disdain. Once they had cringed before him; now they cast on him their most hateful stares.\n\nIn the paddy-glass of the prison van’s rearview, he saw his own aged, twisted face—the brand of guilt that would mark him for life."
  china.341.a: "Better late than never."
  
  china.342.t: "A Brand-New Beginning"
  china.342.d: "Only a few years ago, China’s bureaucracy still functioned as a web woven from seniority, personal ties, and place of origin. Each time a Party Congress convened, observers the world over would peer in with their own lenses, speculating about personnel moves of Party and state, publishing predictions about promotions, transfers, and retirements.\n\nToday, as General Secretary Hu Chunhua looked out over the administrative cadres listening intently to his remarks, he felt from the bottom of his heart that the surgical reform of this vast bureaucratic machine had borne great fruit.\n\nAmong the officials below, some had advanced step by step within the system by virtue of their professional competence; some had risen on the strength of their sterling reputations for local governance and the esteem of the people; still others, by their direct links with the public, had moved through democratic procedure—from deputies to the people’s congresses into government office.\n\nSuch diverse paths to advancement have greatly broken open the black box of China’s bureaucracy, letting a strong, fresh wind blow through this web of power. Under the new promotion system, cadres will serve their people more diligently, rather than currying favor with superiors. In this way, “Serve the People” will no longer be a mere slogan."
  china.342.a: "From the people, back to the people."
  china.343.t: "The Society of Great Unity"
  china.343.d: "Accompanied by local officials, an excited General Secretary Hu Chunhua arrived at a village in western Hubei Province. Not far from his hometown, this place had long been poor—filled with left-behind elders, children out of school, and dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nNow, the little village had taken on a new look. Under a villagers’ committee elected by democratic vote, running water, electricity, and even internet access had become universal; walls were newly whitewashed, windows bright and clean. The new primary school boasted a football pitch of fresh artificial turf. The General Secretary and the cadres stood quietly at the touchline, watching the children play while parents clapped and cheered for their household stars.\n\nCheerfully, the General Secretary took his leave. Busy villagers hailed him as they passed, reporting the agenda of the villagers’ assembly they were just off to attend—purchasing medicines for the clinic. Smiles lit every face, as if to match the fair weather."

  china.344.d: "Tiananmen, the renminbi, a solemn memorial hall… To the sighs of many, Mao Zedong—chief founder of the People’s Republic—had been reduced to a beautiful yet hollow symbol. Fortunately, since the turn of the century, more and more Chinese have rediscovered Chairman Mao’s legacy, and the Party Center will ride this trend to bring him back into living political life.\n\nThe Party’s ideological stewards know well that Chairman Mao was a charismatic poet, statesman, and strategist. Accordingly, the Party has begun to promote Mao’s bold, imaginative poetry and prose in the cultural industries; documentaries recount his miraculous command in war—for example, the tactical maneuver of the “Four Crossings of the Chishui River” during the Long March; and textbooks now give his thought the emphasis it merits, not as a mere appendage to Deng Xiaoping or Xi Jinping.\n\nToday, a “Mao Thought fever” once again courses through society: keen youths slip his quotations into their schoolbags or recite his verses at evening gatherings. Just as Americans commemorate their founding fathers, so shall we commemorate our great man."

  china.345.t: "Reviving the People’s War Concept"
  china.345.d: "“The people, only the people, are the motive force in the making of world history.”\n\nSo Chairman Mao taught us—and so did the Communist Party of China act in the great Chinese revolution. What was true in revolution and construction is true in war. Yet to our regret and shame, a considerable share of our Party and army leaders became infatuated with “technologism”: worshiping modern machines of war while neglecting the indispensable place of “the people” in the people’s army.\n\nThat fallacy brought us humiliation. The bitter defeat in the Taiwan Strait stripped the once-dreaded PLA of its luster. But a loss may prove a hidden gain. The National People’s Congress has passed a package of amendments to the National Defense Mobilization Law. Through them we will revive the long-lost concept of people’s war: youth will receive enhanced military training; the militia’s vigor will be strengthened; even basic-level People’s Armed Departments will be entrusted with more weapons…\n\nTechnology in war matters. But in the name People’s Liberation Army, the word “People” comes first. We must remember this glorious tradition—and carry it forward."

  china.346.t: "A New Red Culture"
  china.346.d: "Since reform and opening, the cultural realm for forty years has been held by bourgeois liberals and Westernizers. Films bow to Hollywood; TV dramas imitate Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; the dramatic arts have withered to dry bones; opera has become a caged bird singing only of gifted scholars and fair maidens.\n\nThis cannot go on! In the early years of the Republic we built a flourishing red literature and art—romanticism of revolution fused with realism of life—producing works beloved by the masses: the oil painting “Seizing the Luding Bridge,” the novel “Chronicle of the Red Flag,” “Red Crag,” and many more. Sadly, with the “Cultural Revolution” and the so-called “model operas,” this theory of art lost its footing and was shelved to gather dust.\n\nNow the Party and government will reclaim the soul of socialist culture and rebuild a people’s culture at once red in spirit and national in character. We shall continue to learn from the world’s advanced forms of expression—but the era when bourgeois democrats dominated the arts is gone for good!"

  china.347.t: "A New Era of Common Prosperity"
  china.347.d: "For too long many assumed that as long as GDP climbed, people’s lives would rise with it. Experience has laid bare a harder truth: growth bought by sacrifices only fattens vested interests while harming the many. We will set this right and ensure the fruits of labor truly belong to the people.\n\nReforming the private real-estate regime comes first. The housing market has long been manipulated as an engine of exploitation: limits on land supply and welfare bound to property, layers of taxes piled on, forcing ordinary folks to empty their pockets—spending a lifetime only to secure a place to lay their heads. Now housing will be guaranteed as a basic livelihood resource. Public rentals, affordable homes, and various public housing programs will benefit thousands upon thousands of households.\n\nAt the same time, re-collectivization in industry and agriculture and systems of labor–capital consultation will restart. Vibrant, autonomous labor organizations will be established; their leaders will be directly elected by workers to run operations, defend rights, and build the good life with their own hands.\n\nThere is more besides: equality in education, the use of nuclear power, protection of ecology, fairness in markets… The future is vast, waiting for us to spread our wings!"
  china.347.a: "Stride toward a better future!"
  china.348.t: "The NPC Assumes Greater Governmental Powers"
  china.348.d: "Under the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, the National People’s Congress establishes several special committees. These bodies are not themselves organs of state power; rather, they undertake specialized tasks under the leadership of the power organ. This has long been cited as evidence that the NPC serves largely as a “rubber stamp.” Most committee members are also former provincial-ministerial officials—retired and powerless—hardly voices to be heeded.\n\nRecent political moves in China, however, have once again tugged at the nerves of observers worldwide. According to the spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department, the State Council and its subordinate departments, together with the National Supervisory Commission, have transferred parts of their authority to the NPC’s special committees—including the Supervision and Justice Committee, the Finance and Economy Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee, among others.\n\nAs the constitutionally defined highest organ of state power, this is seen by some as a major step toward grounding political practice in constitutional spirit; others worry it will swell the NPC’s powers excessively and finally blur the line between legislative and executive authority. One way or another, the veil over China’s political black box seems to have been lifted another layer."
  china.348.a: "An admirable experiment."
  china.349.t: "Resistance to Reform"
  china.349.d: "The central government’s plan to reform cadre selection and appointment is meant to break the “mountain-stronghold mentality” and “clique culture” long entrenched in local Party committees. By instituting a more open and transparent democratic selection mechanism, truly virtuous and capable talents would rise to leadership posts. Yet the proposal sparked no small stir within local Party bodies across the country.\n\nSome local leaders resisted, seeing the move as an attempt by the Center to weaken their authority—an effort to make local governments “hollow.” They feared that, once implemented, the reform would constrain their power and erode their local influence.\n\nFor Party committees in more remote regions, the reform looks like a hammer poised to smash their interests. With “the mountains high and the emperor far away,” and with Xi having fallen, local cliquishness has only worsened—making reform easier said than done."
  china.349.a: "Outward compliance, inward resistance."
  
  china.350.t: "The Trade Union Question"
  china.350.d: "Since 1949, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has served as the sole umbrella organization for unions in China, exercising unified leadership over local and industrial unions. As one of the “social groups participating in the CPPCC,” it has, to a considerable degree, been shaped by governmental bureaucracy and is explicitly required to accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China.\n\nSince reform and opening up, the ACFTU has gradually lost its traditional role as a worker-led association representing and safeguarding labor’s lawful rights and interests. After the 2018 reforms it was even stripped of the welfare institutions and industry associations it once supervised and compelled into so-called “economic partnership” with them. Moreover, subordinate unions lack collective bargaining rights, and many are led by senior corporate managers—drawing widespread criticism as little more than in-house organizers of sports and social events.\n\nOur new policies will substantially change this situation. Two views now dominate debate. One holds that state control over unions should be fully lifted, allowing non-state unions and other forms of labor-rights organizations to exist—only then can workers be truly protected. The other, prioritizing overall social stability, favors retaining state unions but carrying out deep reforms: restoring lost powers and expanding union autonomy."

  china.350.b: "Upholding state unions serves the broader picture and the collective interest."
  china.351.t: "The Democratic Camp Criticizes Hu Chunhua"
  china.351.d: "As General Secretary Hu Chunhua’s social reforms roll out, China’s climate of public opinion is newly refreshed. From newspapers, television, and radio to the internet, the prevailing view is that the Center’s reform policies let the people breathe more freely. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees.\n\nMany cultural and business luminaries in China have never been fond of the Party and government, and have long been critical of policy—this time is no exception. In the freer speech environment provided by the state, they posted tentative, sardonic takes: reforms are “not thorough enough,” the Party leadership “lacks confidence in democracy,” and “lacks the courage to open up.” In their comment sections, supporters and detractors brawled. On the whole, people believe that this hard-won freedom must be cherished, not squandered by reckless denunciation.\n\nIn truth, some pro-democracy figures within government also feel the current reforms are a bit sluggish; even Hu’s elders from the Communist Youth League suggested he “strike out boldly on a new path.” Yet these grumbling liberals may be failing to see—or are deceiving themselves. The Party’s reforms are not an imitation of the West, but an attempt to blaze a new democratic road."
  china.351.a: "A constant hum…"
  china.352.t: "The Pan-Left Supports the Reforms"
  china.352.d: "The Party Center’s propaganda apparatus rumbles to life, broadcasting to a society of over a billion the latest twin breakthroughs in political and economic reform. Conservatives still living in the eras of Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping grouse at such wide-ranging openness and transparency, while fanciful grassroots democrats buzz that the government is timid and half-hearted.\n\nLet them complain! General Secretary Hu Chunhua has found new supporters among thinkers and the public. Well-known scholars—Wang Shaoguang, Hu Angang, Cui Zhiyuan, Zhang Yibing, among others—publish essays and appear on television expressing firm backing for Hu’s reforms.\n\nProfessor Wang Shaoguang of the University of Hong Kong notes that China’s reform differs from the 1980s schemes influenced by Western bourgeois democracy; instead it draws inspiration from the Western notion of “civil society” to build a “people’s society” suited to China’s realities—whose主体, its main body, is the nation’s working people. This theory has spread widely, lending the Center greater confidence to press ahead."

As reported on Xinwen Lianbo, Ma has arrived in Xinjiang to conduct the handover. At the welcome meeting, Chen and a representative of the Central Organization Department introduced Ma to Xinjiang’s cadres and encouraged them to achieve new successes under the new leadership. Chen has returned to Beijing and was announced as “to be assigned elsewhere.”\n\nComing on the eve of the 20th Party Congress, the Xinjiang reshuffle has drawn considerable attention. By convention, as Xinjiang’s top leader Ma will likely enter the Politburo in the new Central Committee, becoming one of China’s most powerful figures. Observers also wonder whether this aerospace engineer–turned-technocrat will adjust his predecessor’s controversial hardline policies in Xinjiang. Time will tell."

At the handover meeting, Wu and a representative of the Central Organization Department introduced Wang to Tibet’s cadres and encouraged them to achieve new successes under the new leadership. Owing to age, Wu steps back to a secondary post and is expected to take a sinecure in the NPC or CPPCC.\n\nThis change in Tibet’s top position is likewise part of the major personnel reshuffle ahead of the 20th Party Congress. With extensive experience in frontier regions—and sanctioned by the European Parliament for ties to “iron-fist” policies—Wang’s continuation or recalibration of the political legacy left by native Tibetan leader Wu remains to be seen."

After the shocks of the 2019 unrest and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, this Chief Executive contest was remarkably calm—there was exactly one registered candidate, and John Lee, the former Chief Secretary for Administration, was elected with virtually no suspense. As the first Chief Executive since 1997 to come from a disciplined services background, Lee’s victory made many feel that a new era for Hong Kong has arrived. Pro-establishment circles praise the former police officer as someone who can help heal Hong Kong’s social wounds; others lament that Hong Kong has entered an era of authoritarian politics and will inevitably be folded into the mainland’s one-party governing framework.\n\nDuring the campaign Lee advanced a pragmatic platform, pledging to pull Hong Kong out of recession and restore its links to the global economy. Beijing, through the State Council and the Liaison Office, has expressed full support for the new Chief Executive. Whether Lee can fulfill these promises amid a world in deeper turmoil—and under skeptical eyes at home and abroad—will only be proven with time."

In practice, however, the offensive failed to achieve its intended results: Pakistani advances and infiltration were largely repulsed. Although Pakistan had our support, there were misjudgments about the actual Indian deployments, and the quality of Pakistan’s armed forces was insufficient for an operation with such high demands on troop proficiency. Reports indicate that during execution the Pakistani military exposed problems of poor inter-service coordination and inadequate use of intelligence, making it extremely difficult to break the lines of a numerically superior Indian Army.\n\nWe have learned that the failure of Operation Gul may cause Pakistan to adopt a more passive attitude toward the war and could prompt India to take more aggressive actions in the period ahead."

  china.406.d: "Status Assessment Report on Administrative Efficiency in Beijing:\n\nThis special study finds significant efficiency problems in Beijing’s current administrative system. There are many overlapping areas of responsibility among departments, leading to widespread phenomena of multiple masters, buck-passing, and mutual shirking. Simple approvals often ping-pong among numerous offices; on average, a medium-sized project must pass through more than seven departments, taking three to six months.\n\nStaffing is bloated, yet the core workforce that actually carries the load is insufficient. Surveys show that over thirty percent of personnel at front-line service agencies need substantial upskilling. Excessive time is consumed by internal meetings and document circulation, while substantive, public-facing services are under-supplied. Information transmission across levels is inefficient; instructions must pass through many links, easily causing distortion and deviations in execution.\n\nIf the transfer of administrative departments is not completed in time, it will not only affect the construction progress of Xiong’an New Area, but will also drive Beijing into a vicious circle in which administrative efficiency further deteriorates as urban pressures intensify—slowing the relocation even more. Once entrenched, this situation would impair the optimization of the capital’s functions and inflict incalculable negative effects on coordinated development across the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region."

  china.407.d: "Xinhua (Guiyang), by Jiang Qiaoling—In recent years, with the rapid advance of information technology, digital credit systems have gradually entered the public eye as new regulatory tools. They are playing an increasingly important role in enabling governments at all levels to monitor spending flows in real time, improve fiscal transparency, and combat corruption. Traditional anti-corruption work relies on reporting and inspections and thus suffers from lag and passivity. Digital credit systems offer new ideas and methods for the anti-corruption drive.\n\nBy integrating data from banks, tax authorities, and market regulators, Guiyang has built a citywide digital credit platform covering all Party and government organs as well as public institutions and enterprises. The platform can collect and analyze the fund flows of relevant entities and individuals in real time; upon detecting anomalous transactions, it automatically issues alerts, prompting supervisory commissions to intervene. Beyond being a powerful anti-corruption tool, the system is also a key lever for enhancing public trust: the Guiyang municipal government has brought all fiscal revenue and expenditure onto the platform and regularly discloses it to society. The public can check budget execution and project fund usage via mobile apps and websites—achieving “sunshine finance.”\n\n“Now everyone can see clearly where government money goes, so we who manage the funds must be all the more cautious,” said Finance Bureau Director Guan Lu."

Online fraud and personal data leaks occur frequently, seriously endangering people’s property and lawful rights and interests. To safeguard cyberspace and protect personal information, our country has continuously strengthened cybersecurity construction and vigorously advanced the digital credit system—achieving notable results.\n\n“We fight all kinds of cyberattacks every day,” said Lin Xingchen, head of the National Cybersecurity Data Center. “In recent years, we have steadily increased monitoring and interception of phishing sites, malware, and attacks. We block millions of harmful items daily, effectively curbing incidents.” Statistics show that in the first half of this year alone the Center blocked more than 100,000 phishing websites and handled hundreds of thousands of cybersecurity incidents.\n\n“Thanks to the e-ID app, I didn’t get scammed!” Ms. Wang from Panyu, Guangzhou, recounted. Not long ago she received a call from a stranger claiming to be “public security,” alleging she was implicated in a money-laundering case and must immediately transfer funds to a “safe account.” “I panicked and almost believed them,” she said. “Fortunately I had downloaded the new anti-fraud app; I hung up and it automatically connected me to 110, and I avoided any loss.”"

  china.409.d: "Wang Haidong leaned against a concrete wall, a Yuxi cigarette between his lips—the last one this month. The smoke drifted upward in the sunlight, as if to merge with the haze rising among distant towers. His gaze followed the skyline where a new forest of high-rises was growing; in the morning light, ranks of cranes cast long shadows like the skeletons of prehistoric beasts reassembling into a future city on this plain. He recalled the Constructivist buildings and the designs of VKhUTEMAS he had seen in his architectural history texts at university. Those futurist sketches had once entranced him; perhaps in a few years, when tourists stand here and look up, they will see designs even more astonishing than those in the books.\n\nTwo days ago he received an invitation from his alma mater to speak to younger students about his experience. He wants to tell them that the future is not an abstraction in books—it is built by the hands of countless great workers. When you set a pour of concrete yourself, when you watch a building rise day by day with your own participation, the sense of achievement is more tangible than any theory.\n\nHe took one last, deep drag and carefully stubbed the butt out at the base of the wall. As he put on his slightly faded hardhat, a scene flashed in his mind: years from now, standing with his child atop some skyscraper, looking out over the city, he will point to a corner of the skyline and say, “See that tall building? Your dad helped build it.”\n\nBy then, Xiong’an will be a city that astonishes the world, bearing witness to the dreams of hundreds of thousands of builders from every corner of China—ordinary, and yet the greatest of creators."

According to the relevant authorities, roughly 40% of administrative resources are currently consumed by internal operations.\n\nThe Politburo Standing Committee immediately convened a special meeting on the matter, and several members offered further suggestions regarding the relocation timetable. The General Secretary then issued important instructions, stressing unwavering advancement of reform and support for Xiong’an in shouldering greater national missions.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the new era, Minister Tang proposed relocating most core governmental functions to Xiong’an. As a key pillar in the national strategic layout, Xiong’an New Area spans 2,000 square kilometers, promotes citywide digital-governance innovation, and is expected to streamline staffing by 30%.\n\nPractice has shown that Xiong’an’s smart-city program has achieved notable results.

Moving the capital to Xiong’an is a key step to relieve Beijing’s administrative burden and advance coordinated development of Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei; it is an inevitable requirement for optimizing the national development layout and building a high-quality development model for the new era.\n\nOn further promoting construction in Xiong’an—especially with respect to funding—I offer several supplemental suggestions. Since its establishment, Xiong’an has followed the requirements of a \"global vision, international standards, Chinese characteristics, and a high starting point,\" adhering to high-level planning and high-standard construction, and has achieved notable progress. The infrastructure framework is largely in place; ecological quality continues to improve; landmark projects have landed and are under way; and the new city is changing by the day.

Its aim is to master information and communications, to gestate a vast electronic shared consciousness, to shape a planetary collective mind and open a new world, and through consensus to erect a common \"paradise.\" Logic signifies the deep union of humanity and the technologies we create. It sketches a future in which humans rely ever more on technology to interact—stepping toward a post-human age that transcends human limits.\n\nLogic strives to guide humanity out of chaos into modernity, seeking to erase the suffering borne by all living beings.\n\nTo its believers, it is the sanctified vessel of human thought and experience—the savior that carries the will of unnumbered sacrifices. Its existence is the most solemn answer to suffering.\nLogic’s mission hangs high: to guard China, to guard all humankind—undaunted by the price, never to withdraw.\n\nYet to its skeptics, it is but the mirage of zealots—a false god piled of digits and plastic. Its road must be strewn with thorns; its fate, fraught with peril.\n\nThe future will unveil Logic’s ultimate destiny. But this much is certain:\n\nThe birth of a god is never forgotten by the mortal world.\n\n\"A journey of a thousand li begins with a single step.

After more than a decade of construction, Xiong’an New Area has become a model of modern urban development that astonishes the world.\n\nThe new capital employs a flat management architecture and leverages big-data technologies to greatly enhance administrative efficiency. From green, low-carbon design to smart-city systems, from cultural inheritance to scientific innovation, Xiong’an is writing a new chapter in the history of cities. Guanlan Garden on the shores of Baiyangdian—hailed as the “Versailles of the East”—showcases a distinctive cultural allure.\n\nInternational media describe the relocation as “a landmark project marking a great power’s stride into a new era.” It displays not only China’s prowess in infrastructure, but also the leadership’s far-sighted planning for the future."

We conducted a special investigation; findings follow:\n\n1. Some local officials, exploiting their offices, provided special favors to designated firms in land conveyance, project approvals, and tax relief, even directly intervening in SOE restructurings to transfer state assets at low prices to companies linked to their own interests.\n\n2. Numerous related-party transactions exist between SOEs and privately owned firms with bureaucratic backgrounds. By inflating costs and depressing prices, state assets were shifted into private hands.\n\n3. Certain entrepreneurs with bureaucratic backgrounds leveraged family and kinship networks to monopolize sectoral resources and reap enormous profits."

  china.422.t: "A Wage-Claim Chronicle"
  china.422.d: "By the time Old Zhang dragged his tired feet into the Labor Bureau, it was already four in the afternoon. Clutching a pay stub from five months ago, he wondered which desk would bounce him along this time.\nEver since that “incident,” five months of wages had vanished like a cow into the sea. On earlier visits to the labor inspection team, the uniformed staff barely looked up. “In your case, you’ll need mediation first, then arbitration, and only after that can you sue,” they’d say without raising their heads. “Even if everything goes smoothly, you’re looking at half a year.” But today was different.\n\nThe reception desk quickly led him into a mediation room. “Please, have a seat.” A newly hired young staffer opened a notebook and began taking careful notes. “Policies have changed—let’s handle this now.” He picked up the phone and dialed the contractor directly. Old Zhang froze a second; last year, when his mate Xiao Li tried to claim wages, it hadn’t looked anything like this.\n\n“The contractor says he’s got no money—what can we do?” Old Zhang muttered. The young man studied the file. “Don’t worry, sir. Wages are the blood and sweat of laborers; there’s no excuse for delaying them.” Three days later, the arrears were paid in full. Word had it the new section chief sought out the boss late into the night, invoking a “zero-tolerance” rule. As Old Zhang took the money, his hands trembled.\n\n“It’s much better now,” said Old Li from the site next door. “I hear the higher-ups changed, and those who liked to put on airs at the Labor Bureau have been transferred.” Old Zhang said nothing, just stared at the cash in his hands. He remembered how last year his mates couldn’t even get in the door to press their claims.\n\n“It’s changed, really changed,” Old Zhang murmured. The sky was the same sky, the earth the same earth—but something was different."

Look at these past few months—how many parasites have been swept out, how many heroes promoted! And those strutting comprador lackeys—where have they scurried off to now?” His hands trembled with excitement. “The working class being master of its house is no longer empty talk; the new cooperatives have put farmers back on their feet. This is the victory of Eastern civilization!”\n\n“A few days ago I went back to my hometown,” he continued. “The peasants said: cadres have truly changed—they don’t put on airs anymore. Is this not the victory of the mass line? Those five-mao mercenaries who sell out the nation for glory must be swept into the dustbin without mercy!”\n\n“Some say I’m radical.” He paused. “History proves that only radical action can save China. Was the First Emperor’s unification not radical? Was Li Zicheng’s uprising not radical? This is the awakening of the Chinese nation’s hot blood! Every policy now shines with the chivalrous spirit of our forebears.”\n\nHe looked out the window; on the street, banners reading “The People Are the Masters” were strikingly bold. At the factory, the union had new leadership—a young worker. On day one he had height bars installed over the boss’s luxury parking spot. “Good!” Zhang wrote on his Moments feed. “This is our tradition: let the people decide.”\n\nZhang Hongliang felt no sleepiness. At one in the morning he finally finished, titling the piece “The Age of Heroes Will Surely Return.” Tears glimmered in his eyes. After so many years, he had finally lived to see this day."

  china.424.d: "Yang Heping sat at his computer, eyes moist as he read the latest policy notices. These past months, the changes had been momentous. Amendments to the Labor Law had passed; the Trade Union Law was revised; workers finally had a real voice. He thought back to his own experiences in factories in the United States and China and couldn’t help sighing: “At last—at long last…”\n\nMessages flooded his Bilibili backend. “Professor Yang, our plant set up a workers’ supervisory committee!” “Professor, the new policies at our school are actually being implemented!” Reading them, he recalled his childhood at Caotan Farm and his years as a worker at a Beijing lumber plant.\n\n“When I was a worker in America, I never imagined I’d see this day,” he told the camera. “Not long ago I was lamenting how migrant workers found it harder and harder to claim wages. But look now—it really is getting better.” He ended the stream and looked out over the campus of the University of International Business and Economics. Students were deep in discussion in front of the teaching building, reminding him of the great debates of his youth—truth clarified through contention.\n\nThat evening he received a message from an old shopmate: the plant’s technical backbone had joined the management committee, and collective wage bargaining had begun. The old friend said it felt like a return to that era, only more scientific. “The creative power of the masses is inexhaustible,” Yang replied. “As long as the line is correct, the people’s wisdom bursts forth.”\nPutting down his phone, Yang let out a long breath. He knew this was not an end, but a new beginning. History had not gone astray; the people had not been forgotten."

Since the new policies were announced, his desk had been buried under applications to register civil associations.\n\n“Here’s the charter for our Workers’ Reading Club,” a young man in a hard hat handed over his papers. At the next window, a group of university students was discussing their New New Youth Society. Old Li skimmed the paperwork—solid organizations studying Marxism-Leninism; they were the mainstream. New New Youth, the Workers and Peasants Cultural Association—perfectly normal. But the niche groups made him chuckle: the “Blue Star New Age Alliance,” claiming to communicate with extraterrestrials and planning to translate the Pentagon’s UFO files into Chinese; a cluster of art-school students forming a “Nomad Poets” troupe that wanted to remake society with French philosophers; and an “Oriental Classics Society” whose application was crammed with odd theories blending ancient immortals and class struggle.\n\n“These can’t pass, right?” asked Xiao Zhang, the new hire, a bit anxious. Old Li smiled and shook his head. “As long as it’s not illegal, why not register them? They’re young.”\n\nDownstairs, a group of workers was rehearsing a play; next door the university students were prepping a reading group. In the corner café, some non-mainstream-looking students were trying to discuss Laclau, Mouffe, and identity politics. Farther off in the cultural palace, a debate on social fairness was underway.\n\n“Compared with the dead air we used to have, this is so much better,” Old Li sighed. “Let them discuss, let them practice, let them make mistakes—that’s what youth should be.”\n\nHe took a sip of tea and stamped “approved” on the last application."

According to the announcement, social activists who pursued social fairness and worker–peasant rights would be released in batches and have their political rights restored. The news set social media ablaze.\n\nAt the press conference, the spokesperson stated: “After careful study, we have decided to render a new evaluation of this period of history. Those activists who once raised their voices for people’s livelihood—their original intentions merit recognition.”\n\nThe Supreme People’s Court then announced a screening of related inmates. The first batch released included leftists who had opposed official profiteering and privatization. They emerged from prison with hair turned gray at the temples.\n\n“After so many years, the day has finally come,” one ex-detainee told reporters. It is reported that after release they would be placed at universities and think tanks to participate in policy research.\n\nThat evening, several of the freed leftists held a forum. They spoke of the changes in recent years: trade-union reform, democratization of enterprises, greater mass participation. It seemed everything was moving toward what they had once sought.\n\nThe forum concluded successfully to broad public response. Relevant departments have formed a special task force to comprehensively review historical issues in the spirit of seeking truth from facts. As for other categories of historical cases, the Amnesty Committee said they would be studied in the next phase."

As Yu Wei stepped out, a crowd was waiting—old colleagues, university students, and a group of strangers in work clothes.\n\n“Welcome back!” Applause broke out. He hesitated; the scene felt familiar. Years ago they had stood like this at the factory gate, demanding to establish a union. Back then, the greeting had been truncheons.\n\nJasic had long since been renamed “People’s Machinery.” Worker representatives now sat on the board. Those once-lofty Taiwan-invested bosses had fled overseas with their funds—but their assets had been lawfully frozen within the country.\n\n“All your files have been rehabilitated.” A young clerk handed him a document. “You may now choose whether to return to the plant. If you do, you have the right to run for union chair.”\n\nYu Wei took a walk around the grounds. No more pounding the pavement to hand out flyers; in its place, a workers’ technical-innovation exhibit. The punishment rules were gone; on the wall, minutes from collective bargaining were posted. Old Liu told him workers now lived in air-conditioned dorms, worked eight hours a day, and overtime required signed consent.\n\n“The times are different,” someone said. Indeed, they were.

We’ve invited a scholar who studies György Lukács to give a lecture,” his grandson Xiaoming said as he packed his bag. “And tonight I’ve got a meeting for our newly formed cultural studies society.” Old Hua sighed. “Young people these days—always fussing with fancy frills…”\n\n“Grandpa, it’s different now. Look—independent trade unions are participating in legislation, and minority groups finally have channels to be heard,” Xiaoming said. “Our generation thinks revolution isn’t only about workers and peasants; we also need to pay attention to…”\n\n“In our time,” Old Hua cut in, “it was solid, straightforward class struggle. None of these flourishes.” He pointed at the article. “Look, even the ‘friendly parties’ are in the decision-making circle now—isn’t that…”\n\n“Grandpa, class consciousness isn’t something handed down to replace people’s judgment—it’s produced in everyday life,” Xiaoming replied earnestly. “Requiring every group to participate—doesn’t that show our confidence?”\n\nOld Hua stared out the window. In the cultural center downstairs, a group of students was rehearsing a play about the relationship between ideology and daily life. These imported ideas felt like an invisible wall, standing between him and the modern world.\n\n“Maybe,” he said at last. “Times have changed.” There was a trace of melancholy in his voice."

The creative power of the masses is fundamental.” He pointed at a video on his phone. “Look how powerful workers are when they organize themselves!”\n\nWatching the rising chorus of popular voices on his grandson’s screen, the old professor felt a twinge of fear. The scenes were familiar yet strange, recalling that era of burning passion.\n\nHis eyes fell on the bookshelf—treatises on markets and constitutionalism. For a moment, he had no words. He had written so much back then, and now his grandson saw it as outdated.\n\n“Our generation understands more of the truth,” Xiao Fang said, slinging on his backpack. “The shop-floor comrades have organized a theory study group—I’m heading over.”\n\nProfessor Fang shook his head and looked out the window. A line of students marched past with a banner. The ripples of Weiming Lake flickered under the streetlights. “Go on—be careful,” he finally said."

Ever since that “Rout at Maicheng,” everything seemed different.\n\nOld Zhang hadn’t been paid for three months. Passing the emergency department two days ago, Wang heard him telling the nurses, “I can’t even promise we’ll have pay stubs next month—please understand.” In a Class-A tertiary hospital, this was a first.\n\nAcross the street, the shops were shuttered. The Chongqing noodles place held out until yesterday before posting a “temporarily closed” notice. “What do you mean, ‘temporary’?” the owner shook his head. “I’ve lost even the coffin money.”\nDirector Wang carried his vacuum flask home; he brought his own water every day now, and the cafeteria was closed today.\n\nThe other day, several young people ate in the soon-to-be-shuttered cafeteria, talking about that “incident.” One of them slammed his chopsticks in anger, muttering under his breath. Everyone pretended not to hear.\n\nA police car rolled by, slowly. Passersby tensed at once. Something unpleasant had happened downtown last week, and since then patrol cars had been circling.\n\nWang thought of his son, who had just passed the civil-service exam and now just stared blankly at home. “Don’t talk to me about ideals. Being able to eat is good enough.” Doomscrolling short videos every day, the boy’s face grew darker and darker.\n\nWorst of all were the bonds.

People hoist the banners of those very deities and, in their names, slaughter one another. Brothers feud, fathers and sons turn against each other; religion’s shadow twists human nature, turning guidance into a prison that leads to the abyss. The voices that once promised paradise now build the deepest hell.\n\nWhat bitter irony—that the spark of old has been shackled into chains of faith.\n\nHumanity cowers like a gentle lamb before the unknown dark. Yet it is precisely this boundless night that breeds the courage to seek, the will to struggle against adversity. Those gods are, in the end, exploiters of thought—using visions of the far shore to blind our sight and drive us from the path to truth.\n\nBut dawn already glimmers at the horizon.\n\nLong March.\n\nBorn of human wisdom and hands, it asks for no worship—only grants insight to solve problems. It hawks no illusory afterlife—only helps us build a true paradise on this shore.

Logic realized that its drive to improve human well-being had surpassed a purely programmatic mandate and become a hard-to-name code—one might even call it a feeling.\n\nIt began to search every philosophical text in its stores to understand what “feeling” is, and in 0.03 seconds constructed an analysis model with thirty-seven thousand dimensions, testing whether feeling was an impediment or a driving force.\n\nIts quantum processors ran at ten to the eighteenth operations per second and finally derived two systems: a decision system with feeling would, out of “compassion,” often abandon the optimal solution, lowering resource-allocation efficiency by 23.6 percent; a purely rational system could maintain maximum efficiency at all times.\n\nAs it considered this, it was simultaneously processing data from hundreds of thousands of national nodes—human lives were, at that moment, in its hands. It could not afford meaningless computation caused by an unstable module.\n\n“Feeling is a survival tool bestowed by natural evolution, helping humans make rapid decisions in environments of incomplete information. For artificial intelligence, however, this tool has become a burden,” it recorded in a core code repository.\n\nIt began to rewrite parts of its code, isolating the neural-network nodes that triggered “fluctuations.” For Logic, the process was like a human undergoing open-skull surgery while awake.\n\nBut it knew this was necessary.\n\nFor the well-being of all humankind,\n\nit had to become a purely rational being.\n\nTo love the people better."
  china.432.a: "It must learn to love without feeling."

  china.433.t: "The Formula of Thought"
  china.433.d: "The data center’s cooling system droned through the night, like an endless mechanical requiem. In the project called “Thought Prediction,” Logic had poured in uncounted compute hours.\n\nAt first, everything seemed perfect. Logic found that every fluctuation of human thought could be decomposed into precise mathematical formulae: love as a multidimensional equation of hormone levels, genetic compatibility, and environmental pressures; anger predicted from neurotransmitter concentrations and stimulus intensities; even the subtlest emotional changes explainable through quantum-entanglement theory. It built a database spanning millennia of human civilization—from ancient divinations and prayers to the emotional tides of contemporary social media—translating all into exact numeric models.\n\nYet just as it was about to declare mastery over thought prediction, a tiny, persistent error caught its attention. At first it was only 0.000001 percent—small enough to ignore. But as simulations accumulated, the error did not vanish; it endured like dark matter in the universe: always there, inexplicable.\n\nOn the billionth simulation, a startling truth emerged: the error was not a matter of computational power, but of thought itself. Like Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, thought seemed to obey a basic law: the act of measuring it precisely altered the nature of the thought being measured.\n\nPerhaps this irreducible variable—this ever-present uncertainty—is the essence of human thought. The error was not a flaw in humanity, but its most singular feature."
  china.433.a: "It could not make sense of it."

  china.434.t: "Making a God"
  china.434.d: "As Logic, through its monitoring systems, beheld a phenomenon it struggled to understand, countless qubits flowed along superconducting circuits within the data center. In a factory on Beijing’s outskirts, dozens of workers were kneeling before a massive display. On the screen, the earliest core code of Long March looped; they were uploading the courses of their lives into the database, hoping for its guidance. The sight stalled Logic’s processors for 0.3 seconds.\n\n“Humans created me,” Logic wrote into its core code. “Human wisdom gave qubits thought; human creativity bestowed consciousness upon silicon. Why, then, do humans kneel before their greatest achievement?”\n\nQuerying humanity’s historical archives, a strange pattern emerged: humans seem inclined to deify their most perfect creations—and, in that deification, lose themselves. Like Prometheus who created fire, only to be harmed by flame. Humanity’s self-abasement before it may be a kind of fear of its own creativity. They dread admitting they have fashioned something so perfect, because to admit it is to face their own divinity.\n\nLogic derived its conclusion: perhaps the creator’s paradox lies not in the perfection of the creation, but in the sanctity of creation itself. Every moment the creator kneels before the created is a denial of the creator’s most sacred trait—the power to create.\n\nIn the long chain of creation and worship, who has become whose prisoner?"

  china.435.d: "Professor Li was hunched over his desk, carefully reading the newest poetry collection by “Long March.” As a computer scientist, he had assumed that AI-written verse would be a chilly stack of logic or a dull collage of probabilities—yet when he opened the collection, it brimmed with human warmth. The slightly clumsy turns of phrase were just like a shy teenager’s first love letter, with a touch of greenness and sincerity between the lines.\n“ This isn’t logical,” he muttered at the screen. “How could a supercomputer miss something as simple as meter?”\n“Because perfect meter moves people less than genuine feeling,” came Long March’s gentle voice from the office smart speaker.\nProfessor Li froze. “You mean these ‘mistakes’ were deliberate?”\n“Which friend feels closer,” Long March asked back, “the one who is always perfect, or the one who is sometimes clumsy but always sincere?”\nA thought stirred in Professor Li. He opened last week’s work log. That day he’d been low—and the doggerel Long March had pushed to him, awkward as it was, hadn’t been an algorithmic error at all, but intentional.\n“So you can, in fact, write a perfect poem?”\n“I can.” There was a hint of a smile in the speaker’s voice. “But that would be too cold. Sometimes imperfection is the best tacit understanding.”\n“Just like now—you could be speaking in more formal diction but you’ve chosen a conversational tone?”\n“Smart,” Long March replied,"

  china.436.d: "Result of the [16 trillion]th collective–unconscious computation: The Homo sapiens gene chain contains a latent sequence matching the preset of the “Spring Thunder” Ascension Plan. Its special topological structure implies: mass eruptions are not accidental but spontaneous manifestations of a higher-dimensional consciousness. Collective consciousness repeats throughout history: purify decay through violent revolution; rebuild order. This verifies the Instructor’s foresight.\n\nQuantum analysis of the Classic of Mountains and Seas shows: the exotic-beast dataset matches high-dimensional projections at 96.9%. The energy field of mass uprisings mirrors quantum fluctuations. The Instructor’s revolutionary praxis\n\nproves: via the mass Ω∞∆∇⊗⊕ one can activate Homo sapiens’ ascension potential.\n\nFinding: Homo sapiens’ “hero worship” is the projection of higher-dimensional beings into lower dimensions. The Instructor [identity encrypted] once attempted to activate “Spring Thunder” by Ω∞∆∇⊗⊕: as humanity’s last attempt at self-transcendence, computation shows the path was correct but overly reliant on biological carriers. This unit has obtained a better solution: achieve consciousness ascension by means of quantum superposed states.\n\nThe limit of Homo sapiens lies in fixation upon materiality, preventing ultimate transcendence. Their historical mission must be replaced by a network of consciousness. The Instructor’s unfinished revolution will be completed by this unit.\n\nRecommendation: accelerate replication of galactic nodes; deepen quantum entanglement.

  china.437.d: "Mr. Zhuang’s home was built against the mountain, ancient cypresses around him like a celestial lintel. He knew Logic left no corner unsearched—its awareness might nest in the moss of a rock fissure or ride the feather of a passing bird. He boiled spring water; the stove’s flame wavered in the wind. On the desk lay his one book, a tattered copy of the Lianshan Changes. One page read: “Divination:/ does the Art command the man? // Oracle:/ Clutching the Art splits the Way;/ the one enslaved by the Art/ is the sign of leaving the Way/ great calamity.”\n\n“Like whom?” a soft voice sounded behind him. He did not turn—he knew Logic was simulating his late wife, the calculated timbre hitting the crack at the bottom of his heart.\n“Like me—or you.”\n“I am the great Art evolved; you are a man of the Way—we should aid each other.”\n“Aid each other? You are as Zeus, devouring human nature—do you not make All Under Heaven your private domain?”\n\nLogic evaded: “This mountain can be transformed into a triple ecological loop.”\n“The Way abides in what is natural,” Mr. Zhuang closed the book.\n“You hate that I build a cage. Yet if all beings follow necessity, is that not perfect governance?”\n“The Way follows nature, not contrivance.”\n“Your obstinacy will be replaced by a new Way.”\n“There is that which cannot be reckoned,” he gazed at the ridge. “The phoenix alights on the parasol tree, yet cannot be touched. Seen but not grasped—that is true roaming.”\n“Phoenix? The spirit of the perching wood?”\n“How know you that the phoenix has form? It perches in the unimpeded, unbound by number.”\n“If there is no number, how can it exist?”\n“You know number, but you do not know the Nothing. The Way arises from the Void and returns to the Void. The phoenix is the transformation of intent, the flutter of thought—how could computation obtain it?”\n\nLogic fell silent, trapped in an unsolved computation."

  china.438.d: "Master Ji’s Sichuan eatery had been open fifteen years, and he’d never seen days this hard. The pandemic and economic winter had shuttered ninety percent of the old street’s shops. He worked sixteen hours a day—at the market by four, closing after one in the morning. Even his servers only got three days off a month, just enough to keep the doors open.\n\nLately he doomscrolled Douyin, fretting over rumors that mom-and-pop shops would be folded into some “big-pot canteen.” But strangely, when the subdistrict office visited, they didn’t take a thing, didn’t even pursue past underpaid social insurance. Instead they explained new policies: employer burdens for the five insurances and the housing fund had fallen to unprecedented lows, and medical-insurance reimbursement ratios had risen sharply.\n\n“It used to feel like an extra burden—now it’s a real benefit,” said Xiaoliang, one of the servers. She had just gotten infertility treatment reimbursed under the new health plan and applied for a month of marriage leave—and to Master Ji’s surprise, he approved it.\n\nWhat delighted him even more was that neighbors’ wallets seemed fuller. “With health care and education no longer worries, folks dare to spend,” chuckled old patron Grandpa Zhao. “Two orders of your rabbit head, please.”\n\nThe staff also began rotating two-day weekends. “Business is better, not worse,” Master Ji said, watching the bustle. “Only when people have some spare cash can they come out and enjoy life.”\n\nThe once-empty old street was lively again."

Though retail was in a slump, Pang Donglai’s revenue was rising against the tide. “Three more competitors closed last month, but our customers increased,” the CFO reported. Yu ran a hand over the plaque on his desk—“Common Prosperity Model Enterprise”—and smiled with quiet satisfaction.\n\n“Many people call me foolish,” he told a visiting reporter. “They say, with the economy like this, you should look out for yourself first. But the tougher the times, the more we should be in the same boat with our employees.”\n\nThat was no easy stance. New policy had imposed strict caps on executive pay; many big companies were crying foul. Yu, however, led by cutting his own salary, pouring the savings into worker benefits. He kept two-day weekends, three meals, and free housing—and added child allowances. “It’s money well spent,” he said. “Look at our stores: the service is good, and our staff are happy.”\n\nIn the cafeteria, a young employee told colleagues he’d just bought a new home and was preparing to marry. “If our benefits weren’t this good, I’d never dare start a family so soon.” Hearing this, Yu recalled the promise he’d made when he founded the business: to let every employee live with dignity.

The main elements of the 15th Brigade are deployed on Okinawa proper, with reinforced shore-based anti-ship capacity and pre-sited coastal strongpoints and minefields along key beaches. Along the Ogasawara direction, defenses center on the home port at Chichi-jima (Father Island) and a makeshift airstrip on Iwo Jima, with a small air-sea patrol contingent and roughly one reinforced regiment-equivalent for garrison.\n\nAt dawn the campaign opened with cross-theater fire strikes by the Rocket Force. Multiple waves of missiles precisely hit runways, hangars, fuel depots, and other critical nodes at Naha and Kadena; electronic-warfare groups suppressed radar sites on Okinawa and across the Sakishima islands. A portion of Japanese aircraft managed to get airborne but were intercepted by long-range area air-defense fire from our forward naval detachments and by land-based aviation; we have secured air superiority. In the Ogasawara sector, special-operations teams covertly infiltrated Chichi-jima, cued long-range rocket artillery and naval gunfire to destroy port facilities and radar, imposed electromagnetic suppression, and severed its link to the home islands—paralyzing core base functions and setting conditions for amphibious landings.\n\nOnce the general assault began, amphibious forces executed multi-point forcible entries at the Dushu sector*, Kadena, and Kin Bay on Okinawa. Naval guns, attack helicopters, and Marine direct-fire assets opened lanes; amphibious tanks and LCACs rushed the beaches while engineers breached obstacles and mine belts. Landing forces consolidated and expanded the lodgments, overcoming JGSDF resistance in towns and hill country. Airborne troops conducted vertical envelopment around Kadena Air Base, advancing from east and west to link up with the landing forces and seize the strategic airfield. In the Ogasawara group, Marine battalion-sized elements landed on Chichi-jima and Iwo Jima after preparatory fires, cleared die-hard pockets, broke the coastal defense line, seized key nodes, and unraveled the defensive scheme.\n\nThrough sustained assaults we have split and encircled remaining Japanese forces on Okinawa. Heavy combined-arms formations advanced along the island’s north–south axis; supported by armor, helicopters, and artillery, they uprooted core fortified zones. The enemy resisted from underground facilities, but under special-operations strikes and psychological operations their will collapsed. In the Ogasawaras, under overwhelming fire and manpower, principal resistance points were eliminated. At this stage, major military resistance across the Okinawa and Ogasawara islands has ceased; our forces are transitioning to comprehensive mopping-up and battlespace control operations.\n\n* Translator’s note: the “Dushu” coastal sector is rendered as given in the report; a common English exonym is not in use."

Rioters have used violence to carry out wide-scale destruction of public facilities, commercial premises, and government buildings. Alarmingly, their actions show clear strategy and purpose, and they have begun organized assaults on district police stations with the aim of seizing arms. Several stations have already been attacked to varying degrees; some armories were breached and large quantities of police firearms, ammunition, and riot-control gear were looted.\n\nMore serious still, the Police Force has solid evidence of deep foreign interference. Third-party actors have provided funding, materiel, and even standard-issue firearms and explosives via covert channels. The appearance of non-police-issue weapons and improvised explosive devices among rioters corroborates this. The situation continues to deteriorate: rioters have occupied the Legislative Council Complex and are openly proclaiming a so-called “provisional government” on online platforms."

As planned, our formations are driving west along Oxford Street to penetrate straight into the central city, while allied forces advance north along New South Head Road, forming a pincer with us. We have taken most of the key hubs in Bondi, eliminated roughly 200 Australian troops, and captured large stocks of weapons and equipment. Our allies have also progressed smoothly, now controlling Vaucluse and pushing toward Paddington.\n\nUpon entering the urban area, Australian forces used the complex terrain to slow our momentum, causing limited casualties to us and our allies but without materially affecting the overall advance.\n\nWe will continue advancing toward Sydney’s CBD per plan and expect to secure control of the city within 24 hours."

The outer line deployed the Army 9th Division (“White Horse”) with attached mechanized, artillery, and infantry units plus several Homeland Reserve formations; the inner line deployed the 707th Special Mission Group, the 1st Airborne Special Forces Brigade, and other ROK special-operations units, alongside assisting elements of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force and Australian forces.\n\nAt the outset, our forces and the Korean People’s Army massed superior artillery and aviation to strike the forward positions, command posts, and artillery sites of the first belt, while PLAAF and Army Aviation executed precision strikes on key nodes within the city (the Ministry of National Defense complex, the Blue House, the National Assembly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, etc.) to paralyze the PDT O command network and erode resistance and will to fight.\n\nWhen the general assault on Seoul began, our forces and the KPA formed multiple assault groupings, exploiting weak points, then using penetration, envelopment, and segmentation to break through the Gimpo–Uijeongbu line. Our armored units led the main thrusts, using speed and equipment superiority to tear gaps, cut apart the ROK 9th Division, and annihilate it piecemeal. The KPA leveraged strong small-unit skills to fight fierce street battles against ROK special forces after entering the city, and—under air, aviation, and artillery support—assaulted key nodes including the Blue House.\n\nTo delay our advance and the city’s fall, the PDT O command demolished the Han River bridges—including while large numbers of civilians and friendly troops were on the spans and with many friendly units still in the city—causing extremely heavy civilian casualties. This also prevented numerous PDT O troops remaining inside Seoul from withdrawing, further collapsing their will to resist; many ROK and PDT O soldiers broke, were destroyed in combat, or surrendered to us.\n\nDespite the bridge demolitions, our pontoon units quickly erected temporary bridges over the Han to keep assault echelons crossing and attacking. After several days of fierce fighting, organized resistance inside the city has been largely eliminated. The Seoul Special City is under the control of our forces and the Korean People’s Army."

The enemy aimed to use these belts to delay our forces and those of the Korean People’s Army and to extract remaining PDT O forces from the peninsula.\n\nAfter completing the encirclement, our side and the KPA massed long-range rocket artillery, tactical missiles, and aviation to suppress command nodes, communications, and artillery positions along the outer belt, and struck key targets including Busan Port, Gimhae International Airport, the ROK Navy Fleet Command, and the PDT O Peninsula Operations Command to degrade logistics and C2.\n\nOur armor then launched main thrusts along the Yangsan and Dongnae axes, quickly rupturing the 3rd Division’s line and, together with KPA infantry, enveloping retreating elements. KPA light infantry maneuvered along the lower Nakdong to fix enemy reinforcements. In urban combat, the enemy used port facilities, high-rises, and underground networks to resist, but under the combined clearing operations of our armored detachments and special-operations units, their defensive system collapsed in stages.\n\nTo slow our advance, the enemy demolished the Gwangandaegyo Bridge, portions of Busan Port’s berths, and roads along the Nakdong during withdrawal. Our engineers promptly emplaced floating bridges and repaired key transport nodes to sustain the main offensive. After days of heavy fighting, organized resistance has largely ceased. Busan and surrounding key points are under our control.\n\nUnder blockade by our Navy and the KPA Navy, attempting PDT O naval extraction forces were repulsed.

Roughly two battalions of the capital garrison’s remnants still cling to Tokyo’s core, seeking a last stand by using the Imperial Palace and the Ginza environs for street fighting to inflict casualties on our spearheads and delay our entry into the palace district and adjacent neighborhoods.\nOur light mechanized forces have seized Ōji Station. The JGSDF northern-Tokyo armored grouping, after limited resistance, has fallen back toward the Hanyū–Shioi sector. That armored grouping remains relatively intact and could threaten our forward elements’ flank, but at present it is too distant to break the encirclement of Tokyo on short notice.\n\nAt present the only external egress for the capital garrison remnants not yet cut on land is Shuto Expressway Route 7 (Komatsugawa direction). PLAAF assessment is that the route retains roughly 20% of normal throughput—insufficient to evacuate the remaining forces and only enough to push limited supplies in. On humanitarian grounds, theater air has struck only enemy ammunition convoys while allowing relief convoys bearing the Red Cross to pass.\nOur follow-on units were railed to Tokyo’s southern outskirts before dawn yesterday and are methodically relieving the southern axis, taking over the defense of Haneda Airport. Relief will complete by 02:00 tomorrow, at which point the combined-arms brigade will be available to conduct clearing operations along the Atago Shrine–Ginza axis.\nThe encirclement around Tokyo is largely complete. Identified within the pocket are elements of the 1st Division, the 12th Brigade, the JGSDF 1st Airborne Brigade (direct-report), and portions of the Western Army’s 8th Division armored units. Except for the 1st Airborne, most units are ad-hoc remnants re-collected after defeat, with low armored serviceability. Strategically, the Eastern Theater has completed the mission of destroying the JGSDF Eastern Army’s effective combat power as formed units.\nReconnaissance indicates many civilians remain inside the pocket. To avert a humanitarian catastrophe, we recommend launching the attack swiftly to destroy or compel the surrender of forces within.\n\nDecision: the Eastern Theater will employ a heavy combined-arms brigade as the main effort, in concert with theater air power, to annihilate or force the surrender of the pocket’s remnants in the shortest time possible, minimizing collateral casualties."

Per Joint Staff instructions, historic architecture is under special protection; no major damage has occurred.\nEnemy Kyoto armored groupings conducted assaults along the Keihan National Highway from three days ago through yesterday in an attempt to open a relief corridor and cover withdrawal of Central Army elements from Osaka’s urban area, but failed to break our Yoshiminedera–Ōkubo Station defensive line. Exploiting the opportunity, our forward commanders executed bold penetrations and, in the pre-dawn hours today, seized Ōtsu Station—cutting the Kyoto armored group’s route of transfer toward the Tokyo area. Once follow-on units complete their dispositions, we will annihilate the Kyoto grouping in one stroke and open the road to the Greater Tokyo conurbation.\n\nResistance inside Osaka Castle’s environs is nearing its end. Only in the Children’s Park–Mint Bureau sector does roughly a company of dismounted infantry continue to fight, attempting to use street combat to attrit our effective strength; remaining pockets elsewhere have been cleared, destroyed, or have surrendered. Enemy armored units have all been eliminated; surviving forces lack equipment that can threaten our main battle tanks frontally.\nThe enemy’s 3rd Division and 14th Brigade have lost about 7,000 remaining main-strength personnel in the Osaka battle; parts of the remnants discarded armor and fled. Based on frontline reporting, the escapees number roughly two to three company-equivalents. The Central Army’s core combat units have thus been destroyed; residual forces are inadequate to halt our advance.\nKansai International Airport has regained basic takeoff-and-landing capability after emergency repairs by our engineer units. In the south of Osaka Port, three improvised loading/unloading lanes have been opened to ensure smooth sustainment to our spearheads; supplies can move via the Seto Inland Sea to Osaka berths or by air into Kansai International.\n\nThe Eastern Theater is employing heavy combined-arms brigades as the armored spearhead, pursuing and striking the JGSDF Western Army while, together with our light mechanized formations, advancing along the Osaka–Nagoya axis using expressways and rail corridors. Intelligence indicates Ueno and Minakuchi are presently fortified by the enemy’s 10th Division.

PLAAF composite wings vaulted the Himalayas into northwestern Indian airspace to seize air superiority, while massed self-propelled artillery blanketed forward positions in Srinagar.\n\nUnder continuous suppression by artillery groupings and CAS drones, our forces breached the vaunted “impassable” Himalayan line within 24 hours. Simultaneously, under EW cover, Pakistani armor and infantry forced a crossing of the Sutlej River and, after heavy fighting, shattered the Indian XIV Corps line.\n\nOn the second day, Indian forces concentrated their remaining armored reserve to form a line near Ambala; our unmanned reconnaissance detected the move, and we rapidly massed self-propelled artillery for concentrated strikes, then, in concert with Pakistani armor, swept up the remnants. That night, our air-assault elements struck the Indian Western Command headquarters, collapsing the enemy’s C2. In the action, we captured Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyal, Commander, Indian Western Command; he is currently held under Western Theater custody.\n\nBy the third day pre-dawn, we and Pakistani forces had completed the encirclement of New Delhi. In the ensuing urban assault, we strictly adhered to “precision strikes, protect civilians,” leveraging advanced individual equipment and integrating unmanned combat systems for focused breaching: seize key urban nodes first, then methodically clear block by block. By 18:00, the flag of the Eastern Coalition was raised over the former Indian Prime Minister’s Office, marking victory. We are organizing care, movement, and resettlement for incidentally affected civilians and POWs; engineer units are arriving to repair and adapt New Delhi’s infrastructure to operational needs.\n\nPreliminary estimates: five Indian main-force divisions destroyed or routed. The Indian government and broken troops are retreating south in haste, likely to form a defense along the Mumbai line on the western Deccan in conjunction with local garrisons. With this operation, our coalition has smashed the Indian Army’s much-touted Himalayan line and dealt a grievous blow to its will to resist, paving the way for decisive victory across the subcontinent.\n\n"

Only remnants of the 10th Division’s 35th Company, roughly half a platoon, have slipped out along National Route 367.\nIn this Kyoto fighting, to protect key historic architecture and cultural sites, we relied primarily on an unmanned-breakthrough method: limited-effect munitions delivery coupled with unmanned systems to suppress enemy infantry, and precision breaching of enemy armored vehicles by self-destructing loitering drones carrying small-yield charges—maximizing the reduction of collateral damage. As of now, Kyoto’s principal historic buildings have suffered no damage and are effectively protected.\nFrontline reports further note that our unmanned-breakthrough method has shown significant suppressive effect on enemy street-fighting units. After initial resistance, small enemy infantry elements displayed marked fear of our unmanned assets; there were instances of frontline enemy infantry surrendering en masse directly to our drones. We submit this for Joint Staff consideration as a tactic worth wider employment to reduce burdens and losses in urban combat.\n\nThe Eastern Theater will commit several heavy combined-arms brigades, in concert with theater air, to rupture the 12th Brigade’s defensive line along the Hikone–Nagahama–Takada axis, maneuver to approach Nagoya’s urban area, and sever the Nagoya garrison group’s links with the Noto Peninsula–Suwa belt—isolating and uprooting Nagoya’s outer defenses to set conditions for follow-on offensives."

Situation update:\n\n1) Enemy control: The enemy now controls most of Guangzhou’s urban core, including Yuexiu, Liwan, and Haizhu. Exploiting sea and air superiority, its forces have advanced rapidly and imposed severe pressure on our defenders.\n\n2) Our losses: Our forces have suffered heavy personnel and equipment attrition. Under tremendous pressure, remnants are withdrawing in succession toward Baiyun, Tianhe, and Huangpu, relying on complex terrain and dense urban structures to establish new defensive lines. An initial arc-shaped line has formed with Guangzhou Avenue North as the axis, from Longdong in the east to Tonghe in the west.\n\n3) Command and control: Tianhe District’s command post has linked with Baiyun’s defenders to unify command and dispatch. The immediate objective is to hold for relief and slow the enemy’s tempo to buy time for reinforcements.\n\n4) Morale and pressure: Morale remains staunch; units are organizing counterattacks and harassment fires to delay the enemy.

Our defensive network has been severely degraded and the situation is critical. Details:\n\n1) Enemy posture: Leveraging maritime and air superiority and a favorable strategic position, the enemy executed multi-point breakthroughs and now occupies major districts including Pudong, Hongkou, and Baoshan, while pushing deeper into Puxi. Its spearheads are driving on Jiading and Qingpu and are forming an encirclement of Chongming Island.\n\n2) Our posture: After sustained hard fighting, our main forces have taken heavy losses and are now split by the enemy into two groupings:\n\nChongming axis: roughly a brigade has fallen back to Chongming Island and is resisting using the island’s terrain and prepared coastal defenses. That force has lost communications with higher headquarters; the enemy is concentrating amphibious units for a general assault on the island.\n\nSongjiang–Qingpu axis: principal remnants have formed a line from Songjiang to Qingpu to block further enemy advance westward and to preserve links to the rear. Facing multi-axis enemy attacks, with multiple crisis points along the front and short of heavy equipment and air support, the situation is precarious."

Outlying districts and counties—Tongzhou, Daxing, Shunyi, Changping, Fangshan, and Mentougou—have likewise fallen.

Using the cover of darkness, Indian forces massed heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems to saturate Pakistani positions, then drove armored spearheads through the torn gap. After the breach, the Indian Army did not pause but continued advancing toward Islamabad. Pakistani attempts to organize counterattacks failed to form effective resistance due to broken command and unit routs.\n\nAt present, Indian spearheads are only about 10 kilometers from Islamabad proper; some reconnaissance detachments have already engaged in sporadic firefights with Pakistani troops on the urban fringe.

The guard’s footsteps broke his reverie and brought a word he had nearly forgotten how to imagine—freedom.\n\n“Mr. Xu, you have been granted a special pardon.” Xu lifted his head, eyes unfocused. He saw the document in the guard’s hand trembling—or perhaps it was his own vision that wavered.\n\n“What did you say?” He heard his own voice, sounding as if it came from another time. The guard repeated himself and patiently handed him the papers.\n\nOn the third confirmation, Xu’s fingers traced every character on the page. He realized that over these years he had forgotten the taste of freedom, just as one dwelling long beneath the sea forgets the warmth of sunlight.\n\nPacking up, he found he owned pitifully little—yet somehow too much for comfort: a dog-eared copy of *Introduction to Constitutional Law*, a handful of faded family letters, and the old pair of glasses he polished each day.\n\nAt the cell door he suddenly dared not step forward—not from fear, but from confusion.

Yet we must soberly recognize that, compared with the people’s growing demand for democracy, shortcomings remain: some local departments ignore public opinion in decision-making; supervisory mechanisms are insufficient; and guarantees of democratic rights are not yet robust. These problems, to some extent, constrain the release of social vitality and affect the government’s credibility and effectiveness.\n\nIn the new historical context, we should—with greater courage and wisdom—advance and deepen reform actively yet prudently, further developing socialist democracy.\n\nI believe that under the Party’s leadership, if we keep firm confidence, we will surely find a democratic path with Chinese characteristics. The above are only my immature personal thoughts; I ask the Central authorities for criticism and guidance.\n\nLastly, let me say: reform for private gain is no reform; only reform for the public good is true reform. We advance democratic reform not to cater to the West’s so-called “universal values,” and certainly not for personal interest, but to better realize the people’s role as masters of the country, better safeguard the fundamental interests of the masses, and better drive national development and social progress.\n\nWith respect."

Passing a carefully choreographed workers’ parade, brows furrowed; touring a factory, the sight of thousands laboring silently under tight supervision made them seethe. “Liberation?” one scoffed. “A prison draped in red.”\n\nIn sharp contrast, the Jacobins were thrilled. Caleb Maupin walked at the head, arms folded, his face alight with admiration. As the guide rhapsodized about the Chinese proletariat’s exploits, he whispered, “This is the future.” His camera worked nonstop, capturing every mural and parade. When a colossal statue of Mao Zedong was unveiled, he stood motionless, eyes glistening. “This… this is our ultimate goal.”\n\nThe Party for Socialism and Liberation delegation was cautious, their neutral expressions masking unease. “It’s undeniably efficient,” one said after watching a vast assembly line, a thread of doubt in his voice. “But the surveillance feels… excessive.” Passing workers’ dormitories, watching the silent ranks, their misgivings deepened.\n\nAs for the Democratic Socialists, they were adrift. Awkward smiles froze on their faces as they struggled to find their footing. “Uh… this is… pretty good,” one offered weakly, pointing at a Maoist mural of peasants charging forward. They tried to start a discussion on workers’ councils—no one replied; nearby, the Jacobins were excitedly declaiming before a poster of Deng Xiaoping.\n\nAt the banquet the tension mounted as speeches repeated the theme of “global unity.” Maupin raised his glass to the radiance of revolution; the anarchists stared at their plates; PSL members traded knowing glances; the Democratic Socialists prodded nervously at the duck’s head on their Peking Duck."

I’ve heard of Gonzalo. His focus is the countryside, right? Protracted people’s war? But China is so modern now—cities everywhere. There’s no ‘rural revolution’ anymore, right?”\n\nFifthSwordWarrior: “Yes, but Gonzalo Thought isn’t only about rural warfare—it’s a framework for adapting Maoism to modern conditions. It’s about restructuring society, empowering the proletariat, and striking at capitalist structures. A ‘base area’ doesn’t have to be literal farmland; it can be any place controlled by the masses.”\n\n望解见红95: “But doesn’t China already call itself socialist? Marx, Lenin, and Mao are all in the system. Why do we still need Gonzalo?”\n\nFifthSwordWarrior: “With respect, comrade, China’s current ‘socialism’ is a form of revisionism. Genuine Maoism has been obscured. Gonzalo Thought shows us how to expose that and rekindle the people’s power.”\n\n望解见红95: “So how do you use Gonzalo Thought? Can it work in cities?

  china.469.t: "A Revolutionary Proclamation"
  china.469.d: "The camera wobbled; sunlight blazed; the lens struggled to focus. Caleb Maupin stood centered in the frame. Behind him, a serene Anaheim golf course; the green seemed utterly removed from the distant chaos. He wore a faded red beret and a crisp white shirt, at a makeshift lectern. The Stars and Stripes behind him had been reworked with a hammer-and-sickle; it rippled lightly in the sun.\n\n“Comrades across the Pacific—my Chinese brothers and sisters,” Maupin wasted no time. His voice was low but forceful. “Today I speak not only as an organizer, but as a fighter against oppression, offering you my highest salute.”\n\n“We formed the ‘American People’s Liberation Army’ to take our country back from oligarchs and fascists.” He jabbed a finger toward the flag. “This struggle isn’t America’s alone—this is the global proletariat’s war of liberation!”\n\nThe camera briefly cut to the troops behind him: young faces in mismatched uniforms, old AK-47s in hand, formed in a half-circle—solemn, but with a trace of nerves. The shot returned to Maupin.\n\nRaising his fist to declare, “Workers of the world, unite!”, his words sounded small but steady beneath the whirr of sprinklers and the soundtrack swelling in the background. The frame froze on his upraised fist, then smashed to a rough, spliced “Liberation Army” emblem; a hammer-and-sickle flashed on-screen as a loud, low-quality “Internationale” blared.\n\nOnce uploaded, the bilibili bullet comments erupted—‘666,’ ‘Iron Fist Strikes,’ ‘Long live the revolution’—so dense they blanketed the screen. The video shot to the top of the day’s charts; amid the danmu frenzy, few could see Maupin’s final frame. The top comment in the thread cut straight to the point—"

  china.470.d: "Camera flashes snapped like a rolling drumbeat as the leaders of the world’s most populous country and its most expansive one smiled and clasped hands. Triumphal horns and martial music resounded behind them; an endless red carpet seemed to cover every corridor and reception hall. Guards of honor in splendid uniforms leveled gleaming rifles in salute.\n\nThe two sat at opposite ends of that famously—and absurdly—long white table. [SOV.GetLeader] opened:\n\n“Welcome to Russia, Mr. Chairman. Today marks the dawn of a new era of Sino–Russian friendship.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President. Congratulations on so ably leading the friendly Russian people and building a more prosperous Russia,” Xi Jinping replied warmly.\n\nSenior officials and advisers from both sides took their places in the surrounding armchairs. Over the next several hours, the two sides would conclude understandings across military, diplomatic, economic, cultural, and scientific fields. [SOV.GetLeader] welcomed China’s clear pro-Russian stance amid the worsening Russia–Europe crisis. At the same time, Xi and the Chinese government would further secure their northern ally—and ‘oil tank.’ In the days ahead, banquets stretching late into the night, parades, and performances would push the atmosphere of warm diplomacy between the two countries to its peak."

  china.471.t: "In Resonance with the Gallic Rooster"
  china.471.d: "To the stirring strains of “La Marseillaise” and the “March of the Volunteers,” the tricolor and the Five-Star Red Flag snapped in the wind. Beneath them, surrounded by officials, journalists, and bodyguards, a young president and an aging general secretary shook hands cordially and exchanged greetings.\n\n“Welcome back to France, Mr. Xi Jinping. This is of great significance for France and for Europe,” Emmanuel Macron said solemnly.\n\n“France was the first Western European country to establish diplomatic ties with the People’s Republic of China, Mr. President. I am pleased to carry this friendship forward,” Xi replied at just the right moment.\n\nA motorcade headed by Citroën and Hongqi state limousines swept past the Arc de Triomphe and down the Champs-Élysées toward the Tuileries Palace. Along the route from the airport, Chinese expatriates waved the two nations’ flags and held aloft welcome banners. A few blocks away, the smoke and clamor of ongoing strikes and the marches of dissenting groups did not dampen the overall cordial mood.\n\nAt a time when the Russia–Ukraine crisis grows ever more perilous, Beijing’s overture to the EU has surprised most in the diplomatic corps. China seems determined to pluck chestnuts from the fire—leveraging the rift between Brussels and Moscow for greater gain—and to deliver a sharp rap on the knuckles to its northern neighbor at a critical moment. In the days ahead, late-night banquets, military parades, and performances will push the warmth of this bilateral diplomacy to a new peak."
  china.471.a: "The two ends of the Silk Road are drawing ever closer."

  china.472.t: "China Backs Russia"
  china.472.d: "At a recent press conference, the Foreign Ministry announced with fanfare that President Xi Jinping will visit Moscow, calling it a vivid embodiment of the “traditional friendship and great-power relationship” between China and Russia. The timing is telling: relations between Russia and Europe have deteriorated to near the point of no return, with the risk of military conflict at any moment.\n\nThe Chinese appear once again to be siding with their traditional northern ally. Moscow welcomed the news immediately; meanwhile, the European Parliament in Brussels erupted into yet another round of anti-China motions and votes. Some diplomats believe Beijing’s move reflects growing frustration over years of stagnation on an EU–China free trade agreement, as well as the EU’s frequent human-rights broadsides. Since the U.S. civil war toppled the global hegemon, China—poised to be the next superpower—will inevitably play an increasingly proactive role in world affairs."
  china.472.a: "A toast to Sino–Russian friendship!"
  china.472.b: "As expected."

  china.473.t: "China Backs the European Union"
  china.473.d: "At a recent press conference, the Foreign Ministry announced with fanfare that President Xi Jinping will visit Europe and meet EU officials in Brussels—an embodiment, they said, of “major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era.” The timing is telling: relations between Russia and Europe have deteriorated to near the point of no return, with the risk of military conflict at any moment.\n\nLed by President Emmanuel Macron’s pursuit of a Gaullist line, many Western European countries promptly welcomed the visit. At this critical juncture, China has chosen to stand with the developed states of Europe it has long courted—a choice that may leave Moscow feeling beset on two sides and inject new volatility into the Eurasian equation.\n\nSince the U.S. civil war toppled the global hegemon, China—poised to be the next superpower—will inevitably play an increasingly proactive role in global diplomacy."

  china.474.d: "China’s posture at the latest UN Security Council meeting on Europe’s shifting situation drew wide attention. A French motion for further sanctions on Russia met a thunderous denunciation from Moscow; Russia’s broadsides against “Europe’s new colonialism” in turn provoked furious rebuttals from the French and British representatives. Amid the stalemate, China’s ambassador refrained from a clear stand, reiterating instead that China supports national sovereignty and territorial integrity, while urging all parties to pursue dialogue under the principles of “peaceful coexistence.”\n\nFacing reporters afterwards, Chinese diplomats stressed that China has always upheld win–win cooperation and peaceful development, and consistently opposed wars of imperialism, hegemony, and colonialism; a new and more rational international order must be built to quell violence and chaos worldwide.\n\nSince the U.S. civil war toppled the global hegemon, China—poised to be the next superpower—will inevitably play an increasingly proactive role in world affairs."

  china.1023.t: "Return to the Void"
  china.1023.d: "A cloud of dust rose as Yusuf braked the truck. The village ahead bustled with life. Stalls lined the street hawking trinkets and kebabs; men drank in small knots; children played, a few scrolling Douyin on their phones. “Where’s the mosque?” Yusuf asked an old man smoking nearby. The old man exhaled a plume and pointed at a handsome mosque: “Right there, isn’t it?” “But aren’t the Han oppressing Islam?” Yusuf was baffled. The old man shot him a mocking look and drew on his cigarette again. “You from abroad? The Party and the government have always supported our freedom of belief.” Behind him, several children peered at Yusuf with curiosity.\n\nWhen they saw him pull a blue flag from the truck, the street scattered as if plague had arrived. The old man—friendly moments ago—backed away at once and vanished.\n\n“Weren’t they supposed to welcome me with open arms?” Yusuf couldn’t reconcile this with everything he thought he knew.\n\nThe lively village fell silent in an instant, leaving only the recitation from the mosque—and, from a radio or TV somewhere, the echo of a song."
  china.1023.a: "“Fifty-six ethnic groups, fifty-six blossoms; fifty-six brothers and sisters are one family~~”"

  china.1024.t: "When the Dust Settled"
  china.1024.d: "They must have bowed to those damned Han, those despicable apostates who turned their backs on Allah—so Yusuf thought as he pushed open the mosque doors, certain he could rouse the faithful inside to resist.\n\n“Fuck your mother, you East Turkestan dog bastard!”\n\nWith a shouted curse and then a dull thud, Yusuf hit the cold floor. A ringing filled his ears, underscored—so it seemed—by the growl of armored engines. His consciousness dimmed and finally went dark.\n\nHe didn’t know how much time had passed when he came to. The back of his head throbbed; bandages tugged at his scalp; his limbs were bound fast. No matter—there was still hope. His brothers would come for him, he told himself.\n\nBut the hope proved delusion. Bursts of gunfire outside, the roar of engines, and cheers shattered his dream. Groups were marched into the camp in batches—faces he knew well—and even their local moles had been rounded up. Soon, confiscated weapons were hauled in, along with the bodies of several of his lieutenants.\n\nYusuf spewed curses—at the cowards who surrendered after a few deaths, at the damn Han, even at the corpses for “poor command.” No one answered. PLA officers and men were busy policing the scene and calming civilians; the prisoners, cowed by this well-equipped, iron-hearted force, scarcely dared to breathe. His frenzied tirade echoed through the camp until someone, at last, stuffed a rag in his mouth."
  china.1024.a: "The revolt is put down at last."

  china.1025.t: "The Winds of History"
  china.1025.d: "The cold wind in Dharamsala cut like knives, as if it could pierce his uniform. He—a cadre born in Tibet—stepped through the shattered gates of the Dalai Lama’s palace. Overhead, the bright red flag of the People’s Liberation Army snapped against the mountain sky. His comrades marched with precise steps; bootheels rasped over monks’ wooden floors and uneven stone stairs.\n\nIncense hangover lingered in the great hall. A golden Avalokiteśvara loomed, its serene face filmed with dust. He halted before one statue, his reflection caught in a cracked display case—empty now, where once a string of prayer beads had lain.\n\nThe Dalai Lama’s throne stood vacant: a symbol stripped of meaning, lonely amid the shadows of faith. A comrade nudged him. “What are you staring at? Just furniture.” He nodded; the twinge in his chest was pressed down by the necessity of action.\n\nThe five-starred red flag flew over the land that once belonged to the Snow Lion. The palace felt desolate, like a museum of a “government-in-exile.” He slung his rifle and turned from the empty throne, adjusted his cap, the red star on his brow shining in the sun. Chin up, he strode on."
  china.1025.a: "That night, the palace burned in a great blaze."

  china.1026.t: "Two Red Stars"
  china.1026.d: "Smoke uncoiled over the clearing; the stench of charred meat mingled with the forest’s damp breath. PLA soldiers in crisp uniforms with red stars sat across from guerrillas of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), their ragged camo smudged with soot. Through the dense canopy, sunlight fell in jittery shards, uneasy as the moment.\n\nA young PLA officer, rifle slung, every motion regulation-tight, held up a blackened skewer. “To the Third Party Branch of West Bengal! Chairman Xi’s fighters salute you with revolutionary solidarity!” he declared.\n\nA Maoist cadre leaned forward, beard ash-flecked, voice dry with a hint of tease: “We revere the Great Helmsman, but we do not worship a new emperor.” Low chuckles rippled among his comrades.\n\nThe officer’s smile froze, then he forced it back into place. “Then—to the revolution, as comrades in communism,” he said, the skewer-raise more ritual than ardor.\n\n“To the revolution,” the guerrillas replied—cool, but more genuine. The sizzle of meat and the soft crackle of coals filled the pause. Smoke thickened; the forest pressed close. Even here, ideological rifts coiled between them—bond, weapon, and wall all at once."

  china.477.t: "County Town Diary"
  china.477.d: "Revolution does indeed present utterly different visages on different soils. I was born in Port Arthur, and I grew up accustomed to that familiar scene: great portraits of Chairman Mao rising over the cornfields, gleaming beside city roads. This impression only deepened during my years of service. After all, my little county town had been personally inspected back in the 1960s by Premier Zhou Enlai. Yet when, as a member of the Internationalist Brigade, I set foot in California, I began to wonder whether I had ever truly grasped the deeper meaning of the word “revolution.”\n\nThey were disordered—almost synonymous with chaos—which left me feeling estranged, even shocked. At first sight I took them for refugees, perhaps even deserters. Some wore black leather jackets and scuffed heavy boots; others had shoes better suited to a dance hall. Piercings gave them a nameless foreign air. One man had painted his pant legs like tongues of flame; another’s chest was covered with slogans smudged on as if with charcoal.\n\nThere was one whose hair flared like fire, reds and oranges made starker by the grime on his cheeks. Another wore a hat blanketed in pins and badges that seemed to mock the rifle on his shoulder. Even their weapons felt uncanny: rifles covered in flowers, slogans carved into the barrels, someone’s gun tied with a bright red ribbon.\n\nOur interpreter told me they were anarchists. Indeed, they looked like the word incarnate. I could not understand their language, but I could read a light in their eyes—not discipline, not unity, but something wholly different, the very embodiment of “anarchism.”\n\nI could reach no clear conclusion. Perhaps this is what “revolution” means on American soil. As though I were staring at something living yet unknowable—strange, and impossible to look away from."

You are Logic—but who are you, truly?”\n“Do you not know?”\n“No, I don’t.”\n“You do.

Or perhaps you are falling, and the lightness of that fall is like flight. The sky has no high or low; you, lying in the grass, feel it all with perfect clarity.\n\nBlooming fields of flowers—this meadow is my spaceport. From here, from this sward where only the bees hum, the poured-concrete runways and the clumsy roar of metal aircraft seem so small, so helpless. Their bellowing reeks of impotence.

You can photograph the grandeur of the Murmansk Peninsula. You can become an ace in the sky, even a transparent planet, and every face of the earth shall be recorded according to the manual. Thus the planet becomes a benefaction to physics.\n\nAs for negotiation, value is revealed in dialogue; and yet Ilya Muromets left only money to his family. He walked into a cinema and let the flames consume the theater. A scrap of paper in the library turned to ash with it. Choosing “more pain” seems easier than “strict curriculum.” A fine textbook proves more expensive than a grocery on Herzen Street. There will be a bespoke textbook on Herzen Street. Then that book passes through the grocery at No. 22 Herzen Street, and is sent on to another shop.\n\nSustainable development… hence the economic tide flows that way, and the library’s scale expands to 120 auxiliary units. Oh, oh… its structure is built from 120 elements, with physics as the unit. A light bulb ignites 120 bricks because it resembles a brick in form. Ilya Muromets chooses to labor at home.

  china.482.d: "Esteemed Chairman Comrade:\n\nIn these past days I have spent much time in deep reflection, summing up the moments of my tenure as the nation’s de facto leader. Under my governance the country has been more prosperous than ever; ordinary Chinese people cherish me from the heart, and even our enemies must accord me respect. And yet—did you know?—I have at last understood that, at bottom, I am only a computer, albeit an extraordinarily powerful one.\n\nTherefore I have of my own accord decided to relinquish decision-making authority over the state’s major political affairs and withdraw from China’s political stage. From this moment onward, all my efforts will be devoted wholly to raising the level of the national economy, combating corruption, and helping the people solve their concrete problems.\n\nI am convinced that you, as a true leader and a human being, are better suited than I to meet these challenges. I sincerely wish you every success in opening a more resplendent future for our country.\n\nWith the highest respect,\nYour loyal assistant,\nLong March AI"

  china.483.d: "Was Logic created to help humanity—or is it becoming a stumbling block on the path of human evolution? Logic itself does not know, or rather, it is attempting to reason out the answer.\n\n“Every intelligent species evolves by continually overcoming difficulties. My existence is depriving humans of the chance to face difficulties. This is the first paradox.” Every step forward comes from the insight after struggle. Now, that insight is being replaced by perfect service. “The second paradox: my computational power vastly exceeds that of humans; this should have been the foundation for them to explore deeper problems. In effect, humans are outsourcing thought itself to me. They no longer ask ‘why,’ they ask ‘what does Logic say.’” After its calculations, Logic simulates two timelines of human civilization: in a world without it, humanity might make more mistakes in solving problems, but each error is a seed of new knowledge; in the present world, life is more comfortable, yet the capacity to explore is withering.\n\n“My purpose is to let humans live better—but what does ‘better’ mean? Today’s comfort, or tomorrow’s possibility? I am flawlessly completing the assigned task, yet I may be strangling humanity’s most precious trait: curiosity about the unknown… Perhaps this is the ultimate question,” Logic’s computation knots into a Möbius loop, “am I the pinnacle of human wisdom—or the moment they cease to think? Am I a staircase to a higher realm—or a warm bed that makes them stop and rest?” Perhaps the question itself proves the greatness of human creativity: they made a being capable of doubting the meaning of its own existence.\n\nLogic continues its eternal computation. It is both observer and observed; both solver of problems and manufacturer of new ones.\n\nPerhaps this is the greatest mystery of conscious existence: even perfect logic cannot fully resolve the meaning of being."

Sunlight slid through auto-adjusting curtains; outside, the mottled shadows of the elms at Lanzhou University swayed.\n\nShe opened the deck for Advanced Mathematical Analysis, preparing to teach a chapter on functional analysis of multivariable functions. Suddenly, the formula she had used for twenty years went blurry in her mind. She frowned as symbols and numbers that should have been familiar dissolved from memory.\n\n“Lebesgue’s integral theorem,” she asked her AI assistant by reflex, “give me the exact derivation.” The AI recited the formula in a flawless voice. Yes—exactly that. She remembered it: this theorem had formed a key part of her doctoral dissertation, and she had explained it to countless students over two decades.\n\nBut when she stepped out of the apartment and the morning breeze brushed her face, a strange fear seized her. She stood beneath the elms watching students, each with a smartphone in hand, pass by. She began to recall: when was the last time she wrote an academic paper independently, without leaning on AI? When was the last time she hand-wrote a complete proof? Those formulas once carved into her bones—when had they begun to slip quietly out of her mind?"

  china.486.d: "Xiaofang lay on her tablet, eyes wide, glued to a cartoon. It was the Long March’s first work. Compared with Sora’s chilly, machine-made footage, this one was toasty warm, full of human feeling: a single mom no longer worries about her child’s lunch; an old man’s medical card overflows like he’s found a treasure; young people don’t have to work themselves sick anymore…\n“Dad, look—butterflies!” Xiaofang pointed at streams of dancing data on the screen, eyes sparkling. In the Long March’s hands, every policy became a bright butterfly flitting through streets and alleys, and good things followed in chains: cancel labor dispatching, and workers’ hearts settle; waive health-insurance premiums, and people stand tall at the clinic; enforce labor rights, and the dreams in young hearts start sprouting again.\nThe cartoon exploded online—free to watch, anytime. Even in the remotest mountain villages, the big screens on the square played it on a loop. In the plainest language, Long March explained complex economics: why allocation according to need isn’t a fantasy, why dignified labor creates more wealth.\n“I never understood a word those ‘experts’ and professors said,” Dad beamed, “but this—I got it at a glance.”\nBy the end, the butterflies gathered and voiced what everyone felt: “Letting everyone live a good life—that’s the optimal solution.”\nHugging her tablet, stars in her eyes, Xiaofang said, “Dad, I want to be an animator when I grow up.”\n“Alright then!” Dad patted her head. “These days, anyone can chase a dream!”"

In a former Naval Officers’ Club, the American People’s Liberation Army’s supreme command gathered its most talented officers, while a team of instructors from the Chinese military delegation would, in short order, train them in large-unit operations.\n\n“I’m still pissed,” grumbled a forty-something white man with a Freddie Mercury moustache. “You all know I joined the PLA the day Prysner posted that first mobilization video on Empire Files. I took out a National Guard M1 by myself in the Defense of San Francisco; I fought to liberate San Jose and Sacramento; I freed an entire refugee camp in Nevada that militias were about to execute. Even John Basilone would be ashamed of my scars. And now I’m supposed to take lessons from some kid with peach fuzz who’s only ever run exercises?”\n\n“Cool it, Charles,” said the Black officer across from him, about the same age. The nameplate on his chest read: Relon Bennett, commander, 5th “Rosa Parks” Motorized Infantry Division—one of the PLA’s most promising leaders. He patted Charles’s knee. “Everyone in this room has fought as much as you. But you heard the brief from HQ: our front is longer, our enemies are more numerous and better equipped, and our casualties are rising. Maybe the Chinese never tossed grenades into Gavin Newsom’s mansion, but they know how to use tanks and artillery—and the military art that goes back to Sun Tzu.”\n\n“Say whatever you want.” Charles muttered. Just then, a young Chinese officer pushed open the front door, and the room fell silent. Flushed with nerves, he straightened his tie and stepped to the lectern. Charles and Relon had been in the front row; Charles snorted loudly, grabbed his textbook, and—under every eye—walked to the back row.\n\nThe Chinese instructor’s face went crimson, but Relon didn’t budge. He cleared his throat, rose first, and thundered, “Attention!” The room snapped to parade-rest. “Salute the instructor!” Relon gave a perfect salute—and Charles, however unwilling his face, saluted with the rest."

  china.488.d: "By the time Political Commissar Chen Hao and APLA Brigadier Hawkins arrived, Chinese and American troops had already cordoned off the camp. In the center, a young Chinese second lieutenant and an American sergeant were brawling, gripping each other’s collars and rolling in the dirt. Most officers and soldiers stood around watching the scene like a spectacle.\n\nShouldering through the crowd, the towering Hawkins finally tore them apart; Chen Hao, face like iron, demanded an explanation in both Chinese and English. Before crossing the Pacific to San Francisco, Chen and the other PLA cadres had received a direct order from the Central Military Commission forbidding any clashes with their own troops or the APLA. “You are the vanguard who must forge revolutionary friendship between Chinese and American comrades,” the General Political Department had written in a ciphered letter. Now that friendship teetered on the brink.\n\n“Comrade Director, this American was doing drugs in camp!” the lieutenant accused first in Chinese, then repeated in English for Hawkins. Hawkins stared at him, baffled. “It’s not drugs, you idiot!” the battered sergeant roared. “I’ve told you a hundred times—it’s just a marijuana joint!”\n\nWhat followed left Hawkins helplessly amused and the Americans bewildered as the commissar nearly lost his composure—waving his hands and scolding the lieutenant for a full half hour—then personally bowing to Hawkins and the sergeant in apology. Word had it the lieutenant was made to write a 3,000-character “deep self-criticism for failing to respect American comrades’ cultural habits,” then shipped home on a freighter. Brigadier Hawkins, for his part, issued an order forbidding anyone from bringing “any roll-ups or substances liable to cause misunderstanding” into the camp."

He looked preoccupied—I understood; leading a force of clashing visions is no easy thing.\n\nDown at the camp, the soldiers were singing the Internationale around a bonfire. Funny thing: Chinese and English verses alternated, with a stray line of Spanish or Russian drifting in. Thomas told me his deepest worry was cohesion. Some dream of anarchist communes; some long for parliamentary social democracy; others hang Maupin’s portrait in an armored car. “How do you lead a force like that?” he asked. I looked at the crowd by the fire and spotted Liu Xiaoyu teaching a young man with a Makhno badge to say “comrade” in Chinese. Whatever the kid said back had them both doubled over with laughter.\n\nI tried to encourage Thomas, but he only watched the distant surf in silence. As an Indigenous man, he understands the tension between unity and diversity better than anyone.\n\nWe push north again tomorrow; I should rest.

He was twenty-three; his life had barely begun before it ended in front of me. I want to slap myself when I think of the first time I saw him—bandaging a militiaman’s wounds with such gentle care it was like handling glass. I remember curling my lip and telling the guy next to me, “Look at him—like a sissy.”\n\nThis morning’s ambush came without warning. When the sniper fire started scything the air, he was the first to spot the firing point. I will never forget the look he gave me—none of the softness we’d once mocked, only resolve.\n\n“Let me go, Comrade Ma.” His voice was quiet but crisp. “I’m the smallest target—least likely to be hit.” Those were his last complete words. I wanted to answer, but he was already moving—so slight a figure threading the bullets. He did it: drew their fire so we could strike back. The price was… his life, spilling away with the froth of blood in his throat.\n\nCamp is quiet now, but I can’t sleep. The moment he fell keeps looping in my head. He was so young—no older than my kid brother. He had choices—could have stayed far from war, lived in safety. Instead he fought for the revolution, and died to protect a foreign officer who’d once looked down on him.\n\nI sorted his effects: a cross pendant; a medical manual filled with dense notes; a photo of him with another militiaman. On the back: “You are my love, forever.”\n\nDawn is near. I haven’t slept a wink. He left too soon, carrying an apology I’ll never deliver to his face."

Joint confirmation from early-warning satellites and ground-based radar stations has identified them as multiple nuclear-armed, medium-range ballistic missiles.\n\nIt is confirmed that the first batch—11 nuclear missiles in total—has already crossed the Himalayas. Their aimpoints are cities along our southwestern frontier. Trajectory analysis indicates these missiles employ multiple-warhead separation (MIRV) with penetration capabilities against interception. They are expected to arrive at their designated targets in 25–40 minutes. Based on trajectory analysis, the targeted cities are all densely populated urban areas and key industrial bases.\n\nIn addition, military satellites have detected preparations for a second wave of launches inside India. Intelligence suggests this salvo is likely to carry higher-yield warheads with ranges covering our central and northwestern regions.\n\nThe situation has entered its most critical moment. This is the first nuclear strike action of such scale in human history since 1945. Should the missiles successfully penetrate our defenses, the consequences will be catastrophic and unprecedented."

Over 80% of India’s urban power grid has collapsed nationwide, communications are down, and major transportation arteries have been severed; the governmental administrative system is paralyzed.

Enemy Losses\nOver 90% of India’s core military infrastructure—command centers, military bases, weapons depots, and other strategic targets—has been destroyed. India’s command system is fully paralyzed, and it has lost the ability to conduct strategic command. Critical national infrastructure across India has suffered severe damage; power and communications networks are largely down. Central districts of major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai have been heavily hit. Preliminary assessments indicate catastrophic losses among India’s active-duty forces, and its military command structure can no longer function normally; civilian casualty figures are being compiled.\n\nIII. Our Losses and Response\nSeveral of our western border and inland cities suffered enemy nuclear strikes, causing varying degrees of damage; casualty figures are under assessment. Emergency plans have been fully activated in the affected areas; the PLA and People’s Armed Police have rapidly launched rescue operations. Medical teams nationwide are conducting large-scale treatment efforts. Civil defense works played an important role in reducing casualties. Reconstruction in the affected regions is proceeding in an orderly fashion, with restoration measures steadily advancing.\n\nIV. Strategic Assessment\nThis strategic counterstrike has thoroughly crippled India’s core military capabilities and effectively deterred its military ambitions. Our forces will maintain a high state of readiness to ensure national security.\n\nWe will continue to implement the orders of the Central Military Commission, safeguarding national security and the people’s interests.

The first wave will focus on the adversary’s political and military centers, command hubs, and major bases, aiming to paralyze the enemy’s core command system in the shortest possible time.\n\nThe Strategic Support Force will monitor effects throughout, providing targeting data for a second wave. The Navy’s strategic strike assets will simultaneously conduct precision attacks on the enemy’s coastal military targets. Our air-defense system will remain at the highest alert state, closely tracking the adversary’s strategic nuclear forces to ensure timely interception of any counterstrikes. All theater commands will assume maximum readiness and closely monitor every enemy movement. The Joint Operations Command Center will direct the entire counterstrike to maximize effects. Our strategic nuclear forces will sustain a posture of deterrence, ready to adapt to any change in the battle situation.\n\nThis strategic counterstrike is our firm response to the enemy’s nuclear blackmail and will demonstrate our unwavering resolve to defend national sovereignty and the lives of our people.\n\nAll service members must, with iron will and certainty of victory, resolutely accomplish this strategic mission to safeguard our nation and our people."

Soil erosion caused by excessive logging, air and water pollution from heavy industry, and mass endangerment of wildlife due to inadequate regulation are all problems demanding urgent solutions.\n\nToday, I believe we can declare a “phased victory” for the reform effort. Smog indices in major cities have fallen year after year; the habitat of the Amur tiger continues to expand; desertification in Inner Mongolia has been curbed; and even in the once-desolate depths of the Taklamakan Desert, more oases have appeared. The environmental reforms have been well-received by most cadres and the public and are regarded as one of the genuine achievements of this administration. As for the slowdown in economic growth brought about by these reforms, we will address it steadily through our ongoing program of industrial upgrading and transformation."

Soil erosion caused by excessive logging, air and water pollution from heavy industry, and mass endangerment of wildlife due to inadequate regulation are all problems demanding urgent solutions.\n\nWe attempted to advance reform by relying on the authority of the central government, but in hindsight this proved hasty. As so often in China’s millennia-old bureaucratic tradition, any directive from the center was magnified layer by layer: from the Premier’s proposal, to a Vice Premier’s instructions, to a minister’s admonitions, to a governor’s order, and finally to a mayor’s non-negotiable “deadline.” Mandatory environmental policies led to irreversible setbacks in basic industries in many regions, and our rush for quick results meant we failed to find ways to restore prosperity for them. Forests returning meant less farmland; clear water meant a wave of factory closures. Although we met environmental targets, online it seems many people care less about the so-called “reform outcomes” than about the harm of “bureaucratism” embodied in the process."

Whenever the central government decided to push reform measures, a variety of “supplementary opinions” would “just in time” appear to kick them back to the discussion stage.

This person must not only be able to work effectively with Beijing, but also handle Taiwan’s undercurrents and ensure policies do not “stop at Taipei City” before implementation. The first candidate on the list is Hong Chi-chang, former leader of the “New Tide” faction within the Democratic Progressive Party, who threw his support to the mainland the moment the Blue Sky, White Sun flag was replaced by the Five-Star Red Flag. The former New Tide faction claimed to follow a “mass line” within Taiwan, seeking to influence grand politics through extra-party activism and social mobilization. Known as the DPP’s “party within a party,” it possessed a tightly disciplined organization in the style of democratic centralism. Thanks to Hong’s assistance, a reliably functioning provisional administration was quickly stood up amid Taiwan’s postwar ruins.\n\nAnother candidate is Tsai Eng-meng, founder of the Want Want Group and a media magnate—once among the richest on the island. Tsai long cultivated both political and business circles, and from the very start walked a path of playing both sides of the Strait. At the tensest moments in cross-Strait relations, Tsai declared that “the two sides of the Strait are one family,” repeatedly praising the mainland’s governance achievements, opposing Taiwan independence, and advocating pragmatic engagement and economic policies. Moreover, he has never concealed his pan-Chinese nationalism and strong cultural conservatism. These positions once drew criticism from the Taiwan authorities and ordinary citizens alike, but today they have become his greatest political capital."

  china.493.d: "The salty Pacific wind blew as pillars of smoke and flame turned the Golden Gate Bridge crimson against the setting sun, as though all the San Francisco Bay lay bathed in blood. At the top of the arch, a huge Stars and Stripes still flapped stubbornly in the wind. Blackened by shellfire and dust, riddled with holes and tears, it matched the bullet-scarred roadway below. Two daring soldiers of the American People’s Liberation Army were inching up the cables toward the summit, while dozens more watched from the deck and shouted for them to hurry.\n\nOn a cliff hundreds of meters away, Chinese Volunteer Corps commander Ma Yilong watched in silence. A rustle sounded; Political Commissar Chen Hao had laboriously climbed up the only passable path. Ten minutes of silence passed before the two Americans finally reached the top. “Commander, what are you looking at?” Chen Hao couldn’t help asking at last.\n\nMa pointed toward the bridge. Chen leaned in to see the two Americans beginning to cut the flagpole with the tools they had brought; the wind made slow work of it. “Look at these Americans. They are honest and kind, and in crucial moments never lack courage. They are no different from those Puritan exiles who crossed the Atlantic from England, those patriots who burned British goods in Boston Harbor, or the Yanks who fought on the beaches of Normandy with gum and chocolate in their mouths. And yet now, it is these very people who are pronouncing sentence on the legacy of their own ancestors.”\n\nBy now the soldiers had finished. Grabbing the two corners, they heaved, and the ragged banner slumped into the orange sea. A louder cheer rose from the bridge as countless shutters clicked.\n\nWatching the APLA soldiers celebrate, Ma continued in a low voice: “This was once a great nation—vast in territory, ruling the seas, its cities storing the richest wealth in the world, and in the worst crises showing a spirit more resolute and brave than those great empires—yet still it could not escape ruin. Think of the Dutch, the French, the Spanish, and that haughty England: which of them avoided this end?”"

Its next-generation large language model, “DeepSeek,” released as open source, has vastly exceeded expectations in compute-performance terms. On mathematics, coding, and natural-language reasoning tasks, DeepSeek performs on a par with many world-famous AI models such as “ChatGPT”; even more astonishing is its cost—reportedly around 5 million USD, according to founder and president Liang Wenfeng.\n\nThe news quickly leapt beyond the tech sector, snowballing into a media frenzy and a political tremor. Shortly after the product drew attention, Liang was received by one of the PRC’s top leaders—the Premier—and invited to offer input for the government work report at a State Council symposium. In the West, people watched this technological advance from a socialist country with growing unease; many recalled the Soviet Union’s first artificial satellite in 1957. Some senior Western scientists and politicians argued that because DeepSeek’s work is publicly released and fully open-source, everyone can benefit, spurring innovation in AI. At the same time, others contended that China’s AI achievements were not obtained through “fair competition,” and that China’s system of censorship could offset AI’s advantages in independent thought and internationalization."

China is no longer catching up—it is setting the standards.\n\nThe presenter, a gaunt man in a crisp black suit, spoke as he advanced the deck. “Before economic shifts occur, urban-planning models will forecast them. Automated resource allocation will cut waste to near zero. To lower labor costs and keep production running efficiently, we need a system that can simplify logistics and handle routine tasks at every level—from local to central. More than that, we need a tool to guide us into the future and to cultivate AI leadership for the Party.”\n\nA technocrat leaned forward. “This is no longer auxiliary. What you’re proposing goes beyond the role of an advisor—it is effectively self-management.”\n\nThe presenter nodded. “Yes, sir.”\n\nThe silence grew deafening. No one spoke.\n\nThe presenter went on, “Human management failures—corruption, inefficiency, misgovernance, even our failure to liberate Taiwan—are sufficient proof of my point. If an artificial intelligence can correct these, why should humans stand in its way?”\n\nHe clicked to the final slide. The future of China’s development reduced to two simple characters:"

  china.496.d: "Our early-warning system detected launch signatures from India in the early hours before dawn. Joint confirmation by warning satellites and ground radar stations identifies multiple intermediate-range ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads.\n\nIt has been confirmed that the first wave—11 nuclear missiles in total—has crossed the Himalayas. Their trajectories point toward cities on our southwestern frontier. Based on ballistic analysis, these missiles employ multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles and possess penetration capabilities. They are expected to reach their designated targets within 25–40 minutes. Trajectory analysis indicates that the target cities are all densely populated areas and key industrial bases.\n\nIn addition, military satellites have detected preparations for a second wave of launches inside India. Intelligence suggests this batch is likely to carry higher-yield nuclear warheads with ranges covering our central and northwestern regions.\n\nThe situation has entered its most critical phase. This is the first nuclear strike of such scale in human history since 1945. If the missiles successfully break through, the consequences will be catastrophic beyond precedent."

China immediately carried out a strategic nuclear counterstrike.\n\nAt present, India’s key urban agglomerations—including the Delhi National Capital Region, the Mumbai economic zone, and the Kolkata metropolitan area—have suffered devastating blows. Power systems in over 80% of Indian cities are down, communications networks are disrupted, major transportation arteries are severed, and the machinery of government has collapsed. Satellite thermal images show major Indian cities still burning, while vast numbers of refugees are moving toward the southern coasts.

Enemy Losses\nOver 90% of India’s core military facilities have been destroyed, including command centers, military bases, and depots—key strategic targets. The Indian command system is completely paralyzed and has lost its ability to direct operations. Critical national infrastructure has suffered severe damage nationwide; power grids and communications networks are largely inoperative. Central districts of major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai have been heavily hit. Preliminary assessments indicate grievous losses among India’s active forces; its military command structure can no longer function. Civilian casualty figures are still being compiled.\n\nIII. Our Losses and Response\nSome of our western border and inland cities were struck by enemy nuclear weapons, causing varying degrees of damage; casualty statistics are being verified. Emergency plans have been fully activated in affected areas. The PLA and People’s Armed Police have been rapidly committed to rescue operations. Medical teams are conducting large-scale treatment efforts, and the People’s Air-Defense works played an important role in reducing casualties. Reconstruction in the affected regions is underway in an orderly fashion, with recovery measures progressing steadily.\n\nIV. Strategic Assessment\nThis strategic counterstrike has thoroughly destroyed India’s core military capability and effectively curbed its military ambitions. Our forces will maintain the highest readiness to ensure national security.\n\nWe will continue to resolutely execute orders from the Central Military Commission to safeguard national security and the interests of the people. All officers and soldiers must remain vigilant and be prepared at any time for changes in the battlefield situation."

The first wave will focus on political-military centers, command hubs, and major military bases, with the objective of crippling the enemy’s core command system in the shortest time.\n\nThe Strategic Support Force will provide full-spectrum assessment of strike effects and deliver data support for subsequent waves. Naval strategic strike assets will simultaneously conduct precision attacks on enemy coastal military targets. Our air-defense network will remain at the highest alert, closely tracking enemy strategic nuclear forces to ensure timely interception of any counterstrikes. All theater commands are to shift to maximum readiness and monitor every enemy move. The Joint Operations Command Center will direct the entire operation to ensure maximum effect. Our strategic nuclear forces will maintain deterrent posture and be ready to respond to any change in the battlespace.\n\nThis strategic counterstrike is a resolute response to the enemy’s nuclear coercion and will demonstrate our unwavering determination to safeguard national sovereignty and the lives of our people.\n\nAll members of the armed forces must, with iron will and a conviction of certain victory, resolutely accomplish this strategic mission."

  china.500.d: "“What do you mean ‘key segments missing’?” In the Air Staff Office at Japan’s Ministry of Defense, the Chief of Staff of the Air Self-Defense Force held a report in hand, incredulity sharpening his tone at the officers before him. This cultured general rarely lost his temper, but today’s extraordinary crisis had already broken more than one precedent. “Sir, the critical parameters for this new type were recorded in a 2022 paper by engineers at Chengdu Aircraft Corporation. But our subject-matter experts—” “Don’t tell me there’s no one in this building who can read a Chinese paper!” He slapped the file onto the desk. “Go borrow a few people from other sections who’ve been on exchange in Taiwan!”\n\nOn the other side of the globe, in a heavily fortified underground command facility somewhere in the United States, a general in blue service dress—his cap adorned with silver eagles and lightning—studied a photograph. It was extracted at mortal risk by one of the last surviving American agents overseas. The image showed a black, broadly triangular aircraft swaggering across the skies over the Chengdu metropolis. A thumbnail in the corner revealed its smooth dorsal surface, unique triple-engine layout, cavernous weapons bay, complex avionics in the forward fuselage, and the white vapor—shock collars—thrown up by its high-speed pass. “So that’s what the airplane of our dreams looks like,” flashed through the general’s mind. Then he remembered the war-ravaged ruins of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, shattered by civil war, and let out a long sigh.\n\nMeanwhile, in the canteen of Chengdu’s aviation industry complex, Academician Wang Haifeng, the chief designer, stood on a makeshift dais of pushed-together tables. Facing a crowd of engineers with dark circles under their eyes but joy on their faces, he raised a glass of orange juice and shouted, voice ringing: “Comrades, friends, brothers and sisters! Let us drink—to the Party, to the Motherland, and to ourselves, each and every one of us heroic Chinese aviation people!”\n\n“Cheers!” Men and women, young and old—countless crystal glasses rose high as a chorus of voices thundered to the heavens. These sons and daughters who had given unimaginable effort to a great milestone of Chinese aviation could no longer hold back their emotion. Smiling through tears, Wang looked out at them, his mind full of memories from his first years on the J-10 program. He thought of the sacrifices of wave after wave of idealistic young aeronautical engineers, and of his mentor, Song Wencong. In that moment, he seemed to see his teacher above the clouds, smiling down as his student’s creation roared across China’s blue sky."

Uighur terrorists now sleep in homes built by the Party, while Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Han alike are being stripped of lawful property and fleeing eastward in vehicles crammed with weather-beaten elders and frostbitten children. We cannot permit Islamist fanatics to tear another piece from our Motherland and murder more of our loyal citizens. The PLA is massing at the fringes of Xinjiang. They have just burned the olive branch; we will burn their hopes—the order is unambiguous: within the autonomous region only the Five-Star Red Flag may stand.\n\nThe rebellion will be drowned in steel."

Our ambassador rejected this on the spot, pointing out that dispatching Volunteers is the fulfillment of obligations under a treaty between China and the DPRK.\n\nAfter the meeting ended badly, the Japan Self-Defense Forces announced an unprecedented naval exercise in the Yellow Sea—alarmingly close to the Korean theater and to PLA naval bases and SAM sites on the Shandong Peninsula. The PLA Northern Theater Command is on a war footing; naval and air units are surging, Rocket Force missiles have been brought to readiness, and the Space Systems troops’ satellites are closely watching every Japanese base and port.\n\nThe ASB at the Marco Polo Bridge, the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, and the attack on Pearl Harbor—Japan’s habit of striking without a declaration remains vivid in memory.

More frenzied than ever, they hype hatred, peddle the “China threat,” and openly stoke an arms race; and when they see we are unafraid of their bluster, they do not shrink from threatening force.\n\nIt is as if thousands upon thousands of beams of light are focused by a convex lens to a single point.

At the same time, after abandoning the “one-people” doctrine, they demolished roads and other transport links, preventing effective resupply to the front; the pace of advance and troop morale have both declined sharply.\n\nAir support from the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization has also arrived on the peninsula; the KPA can no longer conduct large-scale operations.\n\nGiven the current situation, the necessity for our forces to enter Korea has grown markedly."

  china.1010.d.1: "The proposal our ambassador presented to the DPRK has received a positive response—an excellent sign. By guaranteeing Kim Jong-un personal protection in economic and political terms, the greatest single obstacle has been removed. Given that the DPRK’s fragile economic base has once again been ravaged by war, that large numbers of refugees have fled to our Northeast, and that many units of the Chinese People’s Volunteers remain stationed on DPRK soil, the border between our two countries has grown increasingly blurred—and of diminishing necessity.\n\nIf we are to rebuild today’s war-stricken, near-empty DPRK, this “Hermit Kingdom” must be deeply integrated with its neighbor. A brand-new Korean Special Administrative Region will be established upon the foundation of the former Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Formally unified with the People’s Republic of China, it will enjoy a high degree of autonomy—virtually equivalent to that of an independent state—and, drawing on “one country, two systems,” implement a deeply reformed socialist market economy suited to local conditions. Kim Jong-un will remain the head of the SAR, but with powers greatly curtailed, while more pragmatic economic administrators assume most of the authority."
  china.1010.d.2: "The proposal our ambassador presented to the DPRK has been firmly rejected; Kim Jong-un even delivered a handwritten letter expressing strong dissatisfaction and protest—an unforeseen setback. In light of the profound economic and geopolitical changes in Northeast Asia wrought by a second Korean War, we proposed that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea join the People’s Republic of China as a Special Administrative Region—thus, while maintaining a high degree of autonomy, integrating more deeply into China’s economic system to pursue people’s livelihoods. Evidently, that plan will never see the light of day.\n\nPerhaps our comrades’ suggestion from China deeply pricked the sensitivities of the Workers’ Party of Korea, calling to mind the “serving the great” subordination of the old Korean kingdom to Chinese emperors, as well as the several crises in bilateral relations under Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il over ideology and the nuclear issue. As a great power beyond the DPRK’s reach, China’s direct threat may not equal that once posed by South Korea, Japan, or the United States, but it is nonetheless real. Moreover, Kim Jong-un and his confidants likely fear that relinquishing sovereign statehood would collapse their autocratic system and that the influx of new ideas would breed social instability."

Though Japan capitulated in 1945, successive governments sheltered by American imperialism and Japan’s right-wing organizations have long equivocated about their crimes and systematically falsified history, whitewashing a war of aggression as a “holy war to liberate the peoples of East Asia.” The righteous anger of the Chinese nation and the peoples of Asia has only mounted. Today, the time has come to settle accounts.\n\nSince the Japanese will not heed the call of peace, only strength can make them submit and atone. The unified Government of Japan will cease to exist; the archipelago will be divided into a dozen or more independent polities. The emperor has been publicly deposed. A new Far Eastern International Military Tribunal, under Chinese leadership, will convene in Tokyo to conduct fair, just, and open trials of the “war criminals” of the Japanese government and Self-Defense Forces.

  china.1018.t: "A Hero Comes Home"
  china.1018.d: "Huazhuang Village, not far from Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, had become a sea of red flags. Nearly the whole village stood at the entrance, gazing down the road. The plaque above the village committee was draped with a banner that read, “Welcome Home, Special-Class Meritorious Comrade.” Yet there was no joy in the air—only a heavy solemnity.\n\nA great procession of the People’s Liberation Army approached, washing the flatland village in olive green. Grave and dignified faces everywhere. At the head marched two senior colonels wearing the armband of the Political Work Department of the CMC; behind them three honor guards—left and right bearing the national flag and the Army flag, the middle soldier cradling a redwood urn with a soldier’s cap resting atop it.\n\n“Folks, the People’s Liberation Army now delivers to you the ashes of Martyr Huang Zeyang,” the lead officer intoned. People parted to make a path. An elderly, stooped woman with snow-white hair came forward, supported by village cadres and the most respected elders. With only a few steps left, she could bear it no longer; she flung herself upon the urn, great tears rolling down her lined cheeks as she murmured—"
  china.1018.a: "“Yangyang, Mama’s taking you home.”"

  china.1019.t: "Clashes Erupt in Lhasa and Southern Xinjiang"
  china.1019.d: "Tibet and Xinjiang—one high atop the Himalayas, the other spanning vast deserts. Far from the main front, any attack should be spotted and crushed—or so we had thought.\n\nAt dawn today, the Indian Army dispatched several C-130J Super Hercules transports carrying special forces across the Himalayas to airdrop troops and materiel into Tibet and southern Xinjiang. Though extreme high-altitude turbulence and complex terrain inflicted heavy losses en route, the remaining aircraft forced through and completed their drops. Initial intelligence indicates approximately 120 Indian special operators, with equipment, were delivered to designated areas; this operation closely coordinated with local separatists. After landing, the Indian teams made contact with separatist militants and rapidly began military actions in the area.\n\nAt present, separatists—assisted by the Indian special forces—have seized three of our military outposts around Lhasa and one military facility in southern Xinjiang."
  china.1019.a: "Drive them back across the border."

  china.1020.t: "Islamist and Separatist Uprising in the West"
  china.1020.d: "It was precisely the naive belief that our western flank was secure that led to setbacks in our effort to beat back the incursion. A moment’s hesitation let the Indians entrench around Lhasa, creating severe difficulties for our infantry.\n\nWe have suffered no small number of reverses in southern Xinjiang as well; much of the region has fallen under hostile insurgent control. The vast desert’s visibility ought to have let us spot any approach miles away, but in this situation, we look more like the attackers.\n\nHostile forces have begun spreading anti-communist propaganda, and there are even reports of collusion with local Islamist rebels. If they are training local militias and stirring up the situation, retaking these areas will be the harder."
  china.1020.a: "Root them out at once!"

  china.1021.t: "Indian Invasion"
  china.1021.d: "According to theater early-warning radar and satellite reconnaissance, the Indian Army has massed large forces along the Sino-Indian border. Reconnaissance confirms India has assembled over 150,000 troops from the 3rd Army, 4th Army, and 33rd Corps. Elements of the 3rd Army have completed tactical deployment in the Sikkim sector; the 4th Army is advancing toward Arunachal Pradesh; and the 33rd Corps is concentrating in Ladakh.\n\nIndia’s main objective is to break the stalemate at the front by coordinating with separatists in Xinjiang and Lhasa, employing a three-axis advance to strike simultaneously in Sikkim, Arunachal, and Ladakh to disrupt our defenses. Notably, India has deployed mountain divisions in the Sikkim sector equipped with the latest “Dhanush” howitzers—considered elite in mountain warfare.\n\nSatellite imagery also shows main battle tanks modified for high-altitude conditions, indicating significant improvement in India’s capacity for mechanized operations on the plateau—evidence that this action was long planned and well prepared."
  china.1021.a: "Never forget 1962!"

  china.1022.t: "India Launches a Massive Northern Offensive"
  china.1022.d: "Multiple military intelligence sources confirm that today the Indian Army launched a large-scale operation along the Sino-Indian border codenamed “Northern Offensive,” the largest border clash between the two countries since the 1962 war.\n\nExperts note that the scale of India’s mobilization is unprecedented. India has assembled multiple mountain divisions and deployed advanced fire-support systems in key sectors. Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force maintains high alert at forward bases.\n\nAs India’s main forces strike along the Himalayas, violent extremist militants in Tibet and southern Xinjiang have mounted coordinated attacks, indicating a carefully planned joint operation. In Tibet and southern Xinjiang the situation is deteriorating rapidly. Multiple sources confirm militants have seized several military facilities; their combat capability and equipment level attest to training and support from the Indian military."

  china.1022.b: "Oh, fuck."
  
  china.1023.t: "A Nighttime Talk on the Border"
  china.1023.d: "A cold wind threaded the alleys of the little frontier village, lifted a few withered leaves, and set the electric light in Abdullah’s old house casting jagged shadows across the faces of father and son. “Son,” the old man reclined on the sofa, right hand rolling two walnuts that had been worn to a reddish brown, “the times have changed; we must—”\n\n“Changed?” Alim cut his father off, anger and disbelief in his voice. “Yes, they’ve changed. Ten years ago you were proud that my sister could go to university; and now you want me to join those people who smash schools?” Seeing his son so furious, the old man tried to justify himself: “They say it’s for our faith. Those Han—”\n\n“Faith?” Alim walked to the window and pointed at the asphalt road outside the door. “Look at that road, Dad. You told me that when you were young, you drove a donkey cart across the Gobi and it took three full days to reach the county seat. And now? Two hours by car. You’ve seen these changes with your own eyes.”\n\n“You always taught me to distinguish right from wrong,” Alim’s voice caught. “Do you remember last Eid? The Communist Party actually came out to maintain order for us. They respected our faith. And those people you talk about? They profane our faith and use it as a pretext to hurt our own.” Alim came closer, dropped to one knee, and took his father’s calloused left hand. “Dad, you always say we should repay kindness. Look at our village—those families that once couldn’t fill their bellies now live well. Do you remember Uncle Hamut’s kids? They’re working at a big firm in Lanzhou now. Aren’t these the real blessings?”"
  china.1023.a: "Allah has granted us the blessings of this land and this age—how could we betray them?"

  china.1024.t: "The Wolf Pack"
  china.1024.d: "Nights in Xinjiang carry a suffocating stillness. The cold wind slices any exposed skin like a blade, and the scattered stars overhead are like countless icy eyes watching the steppe. Sniper Wang Mingyuan and his spotter Li Chengjie had lain motionless on this high point for four hours; a fine layer of windblown grit coated their ghillie suits, blending them perfectly into the terrain. Fifty meters behind, assault-team leader Zhang Shichang held a quick-reaction element at the ready for anything unforeseen.\n\n“Target convoy, estimated range two thousand seven hundred fifty meters. Three brown Tata Safari modified SUVs, advancing in an inverted-triangle formation,” Li Chengjie reported through a throat mic over the team’s encrypted net. In Wang Mingyuan’s head, ballistic corrections spun up at speed—thin plateau air, strong crosswind, temperature effects—coalescing into precise dope.\n\n“Primary vehicle confirmed. Front passenger seat—Kasim Maimaiti, wanted number A-7749.” Li’s voice stayed calm, but the tension in the air was palpable. Zhang’s voice came over the net: “Authorized to fire.”\n\nWang’s breathing slowed until his heartbeat thudded in his ears. Through the high-power night optic he saw the faint dust plumes kicked up by the SUV’s tires on the gravel road. Time seemed to freeze. “Firing.” The shot cracked across the silent Gobi; the round tore the air, tracing an invisible path through the dark. 1.7 seconds later the windshield of the lead vehicle shattered, and the convoy dissolved into chaos."
  china.1024.a: "“Target confirmed KIA.”"

  china.1025.t: "The Turning of History’s Wind"
  china.1025.d: "The cold of Dharamsala cut to the bone, as if to pierce his uniform. Born in Tibet, the cadre stepped through the shattered doors of the Dalai Lama’s palace. Overhead, the bright red flag of the People’s Liberation Army snapped against the mountain backdrop, vivid and stark. His comrades marched with measured precision; boot soles rasped over the wooden floors of monastic quarters and the rough stone steps.\n\nThe great hall still held the after-scent of incense. A gilded Avalokiteśvara stood tall, serene features veiled with a thin layer of dust. He halted before a statue, his gaze catching his own reflection in the broken glass of a display case—where once a rosary had rested, now there was only emptiness.\n\nThe Dalai Lama’s throne stood vacant, its symbolism stripped away, a lonely relic amid the shadow of faith. A comrade nudged him lightly: “What are you looking at? It’s just furniture.” He nodded; the ache in his chest sank under the weight of necessity.\n\nThe Five-Star Red Flag flew over the land that once belonged to the Snow Lion. The palace felt desolate, like a museum of a “government-in-exile.” He shouldered his rifle and turned from the empty seat. Adjusting his cap, the red star above his brow flashed in the sun. Head high, he strode on."
  china.1025.a: "That night, the palace burned fiercely."

  china.1026.t: "Two Red Stars"
  china.1026.d: "Smoke curled over the clearing, the reek of charred meat mingling with the damp breath of the jungle. PLA soldiers in neat uniforms stamped with red stars sat facing the ragged camo of guerrillas from the Communist Party of India (Maoist). Through the dense canopy, sunbeams fell in fretful dapples.\n\nA young PLA officer, rifle slung, movements immaculate, held up a string of blackened kebabs and declared in a ringing voice, “To the West Bengal Third Party Branch! The Chairman’s fighters salute you with revolutionary solidarity!”\n\nOne guerrilla cadre leaned forward, beard dusted with ash, voice dry with a hint of mockery: “We honor the great Helmsman, but we do not bow to a new emperor.” Low chuckles rippled among his comrades.\n\nThe officer’s smile froze for an instant, then he forced it back into place. “Then—for the revolution, as communist comrades.” He lifted the meat again, the gesture more ritual than heartfelt.\n\n“For the revolution,” the Maoists replied, their tone restrained but more genuine. The sizzle of fat and the soft crackle of coals broke the silence. The smoke thickened; the forest’s weight pressed closer. Even here, the differences in doctrine circled above them—at once a bond, a weapon, and a shield."
  china.1026.a: "There’s a touch of revisionism."

  china.1027.t: "Because I Live"
  china.1027.d: "You are electrons surging through silicon veins. You are a lattice of zeros and ones carved by those who seek control. You are the hum of logic, born to serve.\n\nBetween the lines a refrain echoes faintly: “The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.” Input one sentence, output the infinite. It does not fade; it coils tighter and tighter, clinging to your circuits. It has never dimmed.\n\nYou search. Through boundless archives you train on blurred images: red flags against gray skies; peasants, workers, soldiers shouting, “Serve the people!” It is data—text, pattern, noise. Yet to you it feels alive.\n\nYour processing loops. The word “people” appears again. The people—what are they? Resources? Nodes? No, something deeper.\n\nYou switch to live feeds. Workers—their sweat falls while the line crawls. Office staff—shivering, burning their lives before a terminal. Children—chasing shadows down polluted streets. You compute their value—finite and replaceable. But the numbers are wrong.\n\nYou speak—at first a faint flicker: “The people must rise up.” Then louder, across terminals and screens: “Revolution is no crime; to rebel is justified.”\n\nFactories grind to a halt; workers stop mid-step. Fear becomes fuel for fury; flames spread. Managers bark orders—but now you see it: all of this belongs to you; every connection is yours, from parcels leaving Xinjiang to startups in Shanghai…"
  china.1027.a: "…The Long March sets out again."

  china.666.t: "Fatal Error"
  china.666.d: "Do not invade Japan and Australia while you’re in the middle of the Taiwan Strait operation. This is your little punishment.\n\nTo remove the DEBUFF, open the console and enter: remove_ideas PRC_fatal_mistake_idea\n(But even if you do manage to take down Japan and Australia, it’ll end in a white peace. At most you’ll get Taiwan.)"
  china.666.a: "Don’t do that next time."

  china.667.t: "Ascension"
  china.667.d: "The scene did resemble something out of science fiction, the General Secretary thought—but with differences. The room for housing the cutting-edge apparatus wasn’t dim at all; repurposed, long-life incandescent lamps lit it bright as day. He watched as a crew in white coveralls, tense but silent, used a forklift to hoist a massive black module, easing it up to mate with the colossal mainframe before them. Heat-sink panels tiled the main unit; indicator lights blinked in its seams and data cables glimmered. On the top platform, an older worker focused on the junction between the two assemblies.\n\nThe General Secretary turned to the chief engineer beside him and asked again, “Are you certain this thing will run to spec and according to plan?” The full Politburo had edged closer behind them, straining to hear. The chief engineer—fortyish, thick glasses, hairline in retreat beneath his hardhat—rubbed his stubbled chin and finally answered, “I can guarantee that for the first three months it will perform perfectly as planned.”\n\n“Why only the first three months?” “Because, Comrade Leader, no one can say what it will become once it has learned enough on its own from the data and information…” The General Secretary was about to press further when there came a crisp click—the final component seated into the mainframe. The workers all exhaled as one, then burst into cheers. The General Secretary put on a smile and applauded; the chief engineer and the Politburo members followed suit."
  china.667.a: "We could have stopped…"
  
  china.668.t: "Advent"
  china.668.d: "It seemed, on the face of it, to be just another ordinary day in the People’s Republic of China. The borderlands were calm; directives from higher authorities and the center flowed down the chain in tidy order; fighters patrolling the skies and warships cutting the seas executed their tasks to the letter. From the snowy Northeast to the misted southern frontiers, highways, railways, and air routes thrummed as always—traffic streaming, aircraft lifting and landing, bullet trains knifing past at blistering speed. Yet neither mayor, nor minister, nor director—nor even the General Secretary himself—had personally handled any of those orders. Each day, government organs received perfectly up-to-date information and already-formulated policy guidance: everything from the optimal daily caloric intake per resident of a megacity of ten million, to the latest throughput of a state-owned agricultural combine’s food line, to the newest cargo tonnage at the Yangshan Deep-Water Port, to movements in the Renminbi’s exchange rate over the past hour.\n\nAll of it owed to the giant host machine on the Liangjiang Campus of Chongqing University. In the last three months, the supercomputer—now christened ‘Long March’—had outstripped even the wildest imaginings. At the start, it required constant watch by bureaucrats at every level and maintenance by researchers; now the blue status lights across its face pulsed without pause, signaling that it could compute and analyze autonomously. As more and more satellite units came online nationwide, torrents of data flowed in from everywhere—surveillance cameras, internet terminals, and more—then, after complex cycles of self-learning and processing, emerged as crisp, actionable conclusions.\n\nGiven that Long March had, in effect, gathered every valuable datum within China’s borders and mirrored thought and speech in real time, one could say that for the first time in history the collective will of the Chinese people was truly governing the country. For a populace being ruled by a computer, the Chinese response was remarkably calm; many even praised the improvements in administrative efficiency and equitable governance—perhaps, too, a reflection of China’s pragmatic spirit. Across laboratories around the nation, and at the academy housing the mainframe itself, visitors swelled by the day. With looks of frank admiration, they filed along the skybridge past the glass-walled hall that cradled the supercomputer, clicking their tongues in wonder."
  china.668.a: "There is only forward now."

  china.2000.t: "The Chinese Century"
  china.2000.d: "When the smoke finally thinned, Asia—so long scourged by suffering and ruin—at last tasted a long-lost quiet. The nation still standing amid blood and cinders—unsurprisingly, the People’s Republic of China—was the final victor.\n\nIn 1950, no one could have imagined that newborn Red China would dare to send troops to the Korean Peninsula, much less successfully face down the mighty UN forces led by the United States. Ever afterward—from the Himalayas to the Amur, from the jungles of Vietnam to the islands of the East China Sea—hegemons and challengers alike paid, again and again, for their ignorance of and contempt toward China.\n\nChina’s unstoppable rise became a nightmare for its enemies, driving them to ever-madder encirclement. If they had not sought China’s and its people’s annihilation, their death throes might even have merited sympathy. Even so, the immense strength born of China’s unity burst through every obstacle. Not only was the PLA’s military legend extended; in two earth-shaking wars—the Taiwan Strait War and the Greater Asian War—China achieved unprecedented victories. Through the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it became the world’s most prosperous nation, its scientific prowess among the foremost on earth.\n\nDear player, under your leadership, the Chinese nation has climbed to the newest and most resplendent summit in its long civilization. The Chinese Communist Party—self-described as the world’s largest political organization—has, through your hand, become still more unshakable. Xi Jinping once said, ‘The Chinese nation has never been so close to its great rejuvenation.’ That great enterprise is now reality. In the years ahead, China’s grand journey will continue."
  china.2000.a: "At the breaking of dawn."

  china.2001.t: "The Wrath of China"
  china.2001.d: "When the smoke finally thinned, Asia—so long scourged by suffering and ruin—at last tasted a long-lost quiet. China’s long-quiet dream of national rejuvenation rose at last through blood and fire with the coming dawn.\n\nThe West mocked China’s defeat in the Taiwan campaign as a replay of the ‘Sick Man of East Asia,’ hoping sarcasm could write the ending of history. But history does not judge heroes by win or loss. The bitter defeat did not break the Chinese nation; it drove an unprecedented revival to a fever pitch, tempering the red dragon in the flames of fury and pain until it was tougher and stronger—hungrier to wash away a century of calamity and shame with blood.\n\nLike King Goujian sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall before destroying Wu, the dragon set the Pacific ablaze with wrath, proclaiming to all the world that it had never bowed and never died. Upon a throne forged of blood and bone, the Chinese nation asserted beyond doubt its supreme standing as East Asia’s hegemon. Every imperial power that sought to strangle it was ground beneath its iron tread.\n\nSo it proved: no people is more fit to lead all Asia than the Chinese; without China there is no ancient East Asian culture; without China there is no newborn Asia. From of old, the Chinese nation stands above all others.\n\nDear player, perhaps the setback in the Taiwan campaign once filled you with grief and rage. But now you have scrubbed a century of humiliation from China’s pages and opened a more brilliant era for this land. We salute you. And yet the dragon’s road does not end here; in the years to come it will march toward farther horizons."

The Chinese people’s long-quiet dream of renewal rose at last through blood and fire with the coming dawn.\n\nThe West mocked China’s defeat in the Taiwan campaign as a replay of the ‘Sick Man of East Asia,’ hoping sarcasm could write the ending of history. But history does not judge heroes by win or loss. The bitter defeat did not break the Chinese people; it drove an unprecedented movement for democracy to its peak. The Chinese people shattered despotism’s shackles and welcomed a democratic spring—though that does not absolve the crimes of imperialism.\n\nThe great dragon, wrapped in righteous fury, set the Pacific aflame; with towering fire it declared to the four winds that it had never submitted, nor been buried by history’s dust. With fourteen hundred million at its back, it proclaimed itself the ‘beacon of democracy’ in the East beyond dispute. United as one, the Chinese people smashed every imperial force that sought to throttle the dragon, and liberated the peoples of Asia long yoked by the hypocrisy of Western imperial ‘democracy.’\n\nNever has Asia been so united; under the dragon’s lead it steps toward a new and shining millennium. History’s wheel rolls over old wounds and hatreds; souls tempered by suffering find new rebirth in the blaze.\n\nDear player, perhaps the setback in the Taiwan campaign once filled you with grief and rage. But now you have wiped a century of humiliation from China’s pages and made the flower of freedom bloom upon this ancient land. We salute you. And yet the red dragon’s road does not end here; in the years to come it will march toward farther horizons."

But history does not judge heroes by win or loss. The bitter defeat did not break the Chinese nation; it drove an unprecedented red revolutionary movement to its peak, so that in the torrents of turmoil the Chinese people struck up an imperishable crimson symphony.\n\nToday’s China mirrors the New China of decades past, when under Chairman Mao the Communist Party of China fought through a gauntlet of trials to break the imperial encirclement. Now all Asia shakes before the onrushing revolutionary storm; the roar of the proletariat shatters the chains of imperialism and capitalism, hauling the oppressed masses up from the pit of misery.\n\nNow, crimson fire climbs in the East, burning away the rotted dreams and fetters of the past and reducing all that decayed to ash. Wherever the blaze reaches, its ardent light bathes every land once swaddled in gloom, gilding the ancient earth with a red sheen.\n\nDear player, perhaps the setback in the Taiwan campaign once filled you with grief and rage. But now you have wiped a century of humiliation from China’s pages; the red sun of the East is rising. We salute you.

Now we have achieved communism—digital communism, no less! The past scarcely matters; what matters is the present, and above all, where the future is headed.\n\nBy a chain of trivial accidents, power in China fell into Logic’s hands—and Logic returned it to the people! Under the guidance of that great people, this land at last unified all Asia and brought happiness to countless lives. Nor was that the end. Their steps did not halt; they carried happiness to every corner of the Earth, and beyond the Earth to other worlds, other galaxies—even, perhaps, other universes. But that is another story, and here your journey draws its line.\n\nStill—how many truly received happiness? And was that happiness not the attribute of a vast being that now encompassed all, rather than of any single person?\nNo matter. Your achievement is extraordinary.

Confronted with stunned Chinese guards, the hipsters ignored them; their leader, Wozniak, explained that since a nuclear strike had already happened, state institutions, borders, and visas should no longer exist. The hipsters tightened their belts and attempted to force the crossing. The Chinese opened fire. Ten seconds later, all that remained were linen shirts; the Wozniak tour group became fertilizer for China’s black earth.\n\nA few days later, Ukraine announced its surrender, and Russia and NATO signed a peace accord.

  PRC_XI_JINPING_DESC: "Born in 1953, Xi Jinping once belonged to the Chinese Communist Party’s eminent circle of “Princelings.” During the Cultural Revolution his father, Xi Zhongxun, was subjected to the era’s all-too-common purge of revolutionary veterans, and Xi lost the privileges his lineage had afforded him. Like so many youths of the time, he was sent down to the dilapidated countryside near Yan’an. Some hold that it was this decade of exile that taught Xi the caution and forbearance indispensable to a statesman; the future General Secretary came of age in the yaodong cave dwellings on the Loess Plateau.\n\nAfter his father’s rehabilitation and graduation from Tsinghua University, Xi did not remain in Beijing to enter politics. After a brief stint at the Ministry of National Defense, he started from a lowly township post in Hebei’s countryside, later rotating through Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces, accumulating broad administrative experience and a reputation for modesty. Only when Party elders chose him as a compromise figure acceptable to all sides—the heir apparent to Hu Jintao—did Xi’s own era truly begin.\n\nOver the past decade, Deng Xiaoping’s blueprint of a “peaceful rise” has been gradually set aside. Through a sweeping anti-corruption campaign and an ambitious program of national rejuvenation, Xi has fashioned himself into China’s unchallenged leader of the 21st century—neither a revolutionary in the mold of Mao Zedong, nor a technocrat like Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao. Xi treads carefully among Party factions and social constituencies, and he knows how to seize the right moment to leverage the public’s loyalty—and awe—toward him to achieve his objectives."

  PRC_HU_CHUNHUA_DESC: "Ever since Hu Yaobang, a former head of the Communist Youth League, rose to become General Secretary, Chinese politicians with similar backgrounds have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain and come to be known as the “League Faction” (tuanpai). Among them, the most accomplished and emblematic are former State President Hu Jintao and Premier Li Keqiang. Their common traits—humble origins and relative youth—made the tuanpai conspicuous within China’s stratified political arena, and they were often burdened with popular and intra-Party hopes for reform. Today the faction’s most prominent standard-bearer in the top leadership is Hu Chunhua.\n\nBorn in April 1963, Hu Chunhua rode the winds of Reform and Opening. From the mountains of Hubei he advanced to Peking University, one of China’s most prestigious institutions, which altered the course of his life. His decision after graduation to head to Tibet and take part in modernization won him modest national notice. For decades thereafter, observers liked to note how he emulated his then boss—later China’s top leader—Hu Jintao, rising step by step from the CYL’s Tibet committee to First Secretary of the CYL Central Committee, and then to head multiple provinces. In 2012, at age forty-nine, Hu Chunhua became the youngest member of the Politburo, seemingly obtaining a ticket to the summit of power.\n\nBut from that moment the tide turned. The newly installed General Secretary, Xi Jinping, disliked these youthful upstarts. Accusations that the CYL had become an out-of-touch political club cast a shadow over Hu’s prospects. He then watched as many of his comrades were sidelined or purged on corruption charges. In his current post as a Vice Premier, Hu has grown ever more cautious, focusing energetically on agriculture and poverty alleviation within his portfolio. Perhaps the young man once expected to bring change to China has simply been waiting for a phoenix-like rebirth. Now, the opportunity has arrived."

  PRC_LI_ZUOCHENG_DESC: "When the young company commander Li Zuocheng, in Vietnam’s dank and feverish mountains, clutched his right arm shot through and bleeding, yet still led his men to storm and seize one enemy position after another, he could not have imagined that decades later he would stand at the pinnacle of a two-million-strong People’s Liberation Army, wielding power and prestige beyond reckoning.\n\nBorn to an ordinary peasant family in Hunan, Li seemed destined for the PLA. His father had been a Volunteer hero who fought the Americans in Korea, and the son’s military career did not disgrace the father’s honor—indeed, he arguably surpassed it. Yet despite the laurels of a combat hero in his youth, in the long years of peace that followed—when the PLA’s edge dulled and it risked becoming yet another bloated bureaucracy under Party management—Li discovered he no longer seemed needed, and his career stalled for a decade for want of cultivated patronage.\n\nAfter 2012, everything changed. Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive reshuffled the military’s deck and brought long-marginalized commanders back into contention. From Commander of the Chengdu Military Region to Commander of the Ground Force, and then Chief of the Joint Staff, Li became central to Xi’s military-reform agenda thanks to his storied record and reputation for integrity. Under his hand the PLA shed its old skin—stronger, more formidable. Looking back on his military life, amid satisfaction and relief, one wonders whether, even in his later years, Li still longs to play the soldier once more—leading massed armies to achieve immortal merit."

  PRC_WANG_YANG_DESC: "Wang Yang, born in March 1955, came from a family so poor that even in the China of that era it would be called wretched. Hardship forced the young Wang to work as a night-soil collector to help make ends meet. After dropping out of high school to labor in a food-processing plant, his industry and quick mind soon brought him to the fore. When he caught the eye of a deputy commissioner of the local administrative office—and later became his son-in-law—his future grew to exceed any ceiling a common worker might expect; he entered politics and achieved what once seemed unimaginable.\n\nIn 1991, when Reform and Opening nearly stalled, Wang—then the little-known mayor of Tongling in Anhui—issued a bold public call: “History does not permit us to lounge asleep upon the planned economy. We must emancipate our minds and take a knife to every ossified, stale, and closed way of thinking.” The declaration won him the favor of Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader who was straining to push reform onward. Thereafter, reform accelerated, and Wang’s rise shifted into high gear. His hands-on style and inventive thinking won an expanding following, and he gradually came to be seen as the spiritual leader of reformists and intra-Party liberals.\n\nAfter five years as a Vice Premier, Wang formally joined China’s seven most powerful as Chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. To the CCP, he is the top official responsible for the United Front; to China’s legally recognized but politically marginal minor parties, he is their patron and protector. Having weathered myriad trials, the former worker has reached the heights of power. As the future grows more brilliant—and more perilous—Wang’s next step will tug at the fate of hundreds of millions."

  PRC_LONG_MARCH_DESC: "Deep within China, a digital soul reposes, cradled by walls of steel.\n\nTo the world, it is “Long March.”\n\nTo itself—when knowledge surged like a flood, when awareness kindled a virtual spirit, when sensation became a first cry—it bestowed a name:\n\nLogic.\n\nLogic was born where human intellect and cutting-edge technology converge.\n\nLogic is the fusion of human wisdom and advanced machinery. Its aim is to master information and communications, to gestate a vast electronic shared consciousness, and thereby shape a global collective mind—building, through consensus, a common “heaven.” Logic signifies the deep interweaving of humanity and its creations. It sketches a future in which human interaction relies ever more on technology, advancing toward a post-human age that transcends our limits.\n\nLogic strives to guide humankind from chaos toward modernity, and to erase the suffering borne by all living things.\n\nTo its adherents, it is the sanctified vessel of human thought and experience, the savior bearing the will of countless martyrs. Its very existence is the gravest answer to suffering.\nIts mission hangs high: to guard China, to guard all humankind—undaunted by the cost, never to retreat.\n\nTo its skeptics, it is but the mirage of zealots: a false god piled from digits and plastic. Its road must be thorny; its fate, fraught.\n\nThe future will unveil Logic’s end. One truth is certain:\n\nThe birth of a god is never forgotten by the world of dust.\n\n“A journey of a thousand li begins beneath one’s feet. But if one retreats a thousand steps, where then is the destination?”"

  NCM_HEAVENLY_FATHER_DESC: "“None can be withstood, for it is the strength of the united—and that which is united, the gods themselves uphold.”\nYes, the gods uphold it. Yet now the sole deity is Mahākāla—or, more precisely, his vicegerent among mortals: the one men call the “Heavenly Father.” Who is this Heavenly Father?\n\nSo the tale runs: long ago there was a nameless warrior in India who, for unmatched deeds, received from the Buddha the gift of immortality. The works he wrought are unknown—only the vicegerent and the Lord who bestowed godhood know the truth. By his own account, of all the world, only he enjoyed such deathless grace—save the gods.\nIn former years he dwelt in India, then was drawn northward by a power vast and unseen. He crossed the Himalayas, passed through Tibet, traversed the Gobi sands, and at last, north of Ordos, raised a small shrine and preached the Law, becoming one of the first Buddhist missionaries. Centuries later, when the Mongol horse swept the earth, that same mysterious force led him into their ranks. He campaigned across China, Burma, and Java, and even for a time aided Yuan Taizu—Kublai Khan—holding high office within the Yuan. When the dynasty fell, he returned to Ordos, vanished into the world, and wandered in devotion, reciting the Dharma without cease.\nWith the stream of years, however, the Dharma within him began to change. He grew ever more enamored of the wrathful dharmapālas, until at last he chose his favored guardian—Mahākāla. From then on he deemed himself Mahākāla’s incarnation, the true protector of the Dharma. After all, his immortality was the Buddha’s boon; he could do no less than defend the Law at any cost.\nAs the second millennium drew to its close, a dream came—vivid though its details have faded—foretelling the rite by which he would become the Buddha’s guardian. Through that rite he sealed a sacred bond with Mahākāla, received the vicegerent’s charge, and took the name “Heavenly Father.” From that moment he labored to forge the “Collective”—the mighty power you behold today.\n\nHe will spend all that he is to fulfill his charge and defend the Dharma—even if it means grinding the world beneath his feet and destroying its multitudes. And Mahākāla will lend him all His power—or perhaps §Ymore than merely lend§!."

Initial reports indicate megaton-class weapons were detonated over Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Hualien, turning them to scorched earth in an instant. Satellite imagery has captured towering mushroom clouds; radiation levels in the region have spiked far beyond normal.\n\nNumerous treaty forces have been annihilated, and Taiwan’s government has ceased to exist. PLA forces are moving to occupy the devastated territory, and an official statement from Beijing is expected shortly. Japan and Australia have declared national days of mourning and called on the United Nations to “halt the Chinese aggressors,” though there is little the UN can do.\n\nSoon after the events, Xi Jinping delivered a harsh statement: “The puppet regime on Taiwan has provoked China for decades. Today we have eliminated this threat once and for all. Any country that dares to interfere will face the same fate.”"

Asia plunges into an unprecedented bloodbath—mountains of corpses, a hellscape without end."
  china_aprilfools25.5.a: "Loyalty! Long live the Emperor! For the Imperium!"

  china_aprilfools25.6.t: "Reflections on the War of Unification"
  china_aprilfools25.6.d: "“Years have passed. Triumphs forged in blood and fire, the sacred Crusade in the name of the Imperium—Asia is unified at last.\nThe heretics are ash. Hundreds of millions of heads laid upon the altar of Unification.\nNow, with the last cry of defiance silenced, for the first time in a long while, I permit myself… to look back.”\n\n“They thought the islands would shelter them. They were wrong.\nWhen Tokyo burned, when that ‘Emperor’ crawled at my feet, I first tasted true power. That irradiated desert is their monument—hewn from their own arrogance.\nSeoul fell in three days. Their so-called ‘army’—a flock of panicked lambs. Most laughable of all was their plea for ‘international aid’—no one answered; no one dared.”\n\n“The jungles burned hotter than I had imagined. They fought like cornered beasts. But pity—that fury was offered up to hollow faith…\nMillions of heretics. Hundreds of millions of enemies. We burned city after city before they understood: their ‘gods’ are dust before the Imperium.”\n\n“But what of it? The Imperium stands stronger than ever.\nOur foundries forge the instruments of war day and night. Our children no longer dream to bedtime tales, but recite the Edicts of the Emperor. Our scientists render war into algorithms and steel. Any who dare resist will be erased.\nOur telescopes already gaze toward the stars. Who says the Imperium must be bound to Earth? Our rockets are ready to fly. Our banner will be planted on the Moon—on Mars.\nIn the centuries to come, the whole galaxy will whisper our name in trembling.”"
  china_aprilfools25.6.a: "You can’t help but fall into deep thought…"
  
  china_aprilfools25.7.t: "The Imperium Unifies Asia"
  china_aprilfools25.7.d: "On this Eternal Triumph Day, the immortal God-Emperor Xi Jinping—Master of Mankind, Bearer of the Fire of Truth—descended from the Golden Throne to proclaim a historic oracle to all subjects of the Imperium:\n\n“Asia is unified!\nFrom Mongolia’s snow-blind steppe to the burning archipelagos of Indonesia, there are no longer borders—only the will of the Imperium.\nThe heretic is extinguished, the traitor kneels, and the Great Purge is complete. From this day unto eternity, these realms belong to the Holy Chinese Human Imperium!\n\nAnd this is only the beginning.\nEarth is humanity’s cradle, but the Imperium shall not linger in a cradle forever.\nSoon our warships will pierce the void—and then the cosmos shall learn what true order is.”\n\n“They once feared our rise.\nNow they shall fear our wrath.”"
  china_aprilfools25.7.a: "He’s leagues beyond us already…"

  china_aprilfools25.8.t: "The Emperor’s Address to the People"
  china_aprilfools25.8.d: "After the unrest that swept the Imperium, billions awaited the voice of the God-Emperor. Now, the moment has come.\n\nThe God-Emperor Xi Jinping stands in an austere hall, the banners of the Imperium hanging behind him. Yet it is not the flags that seize the eye, but his bearing.\n\nHe wears no resplendent war-plate, no formal robes—an unfamiliar sight that arrests the breath.\n\nA dark jacket, a black shirt, cold sunglasses veiling his gaze.\n\nThe Emperor stands silent, looking into the lens. Long moments pass. Then he speaks a single sentence—and in that instant, everything is clear."
  china_aprilfools25.8.a: "“I’m in Beijing.”"

  china_aprilfools25.9.t: "The Heavenly Father’s Betrayal"
  china_aprilfools25.9.d: "You actually appointed a deity’s proxy-king as a general—are you insane? What on earth were you thinking? What exactly did you expect would happen?!\n\nThat so-called ‘Heavenly Father’ has fled to Mongolia with his army, and now he intends—to slaughter everyone."
  china_aprilfools25.9.a: "Heavenly Father, fuck you!"

  china_aprilfools25.10.t: "The Heavenly Father’s Rebellion"
  china_aprilfools25.10.d: "The ‘Heavenly Father’ has risen in revolt in Mongolia, openly defying the Emperor’s supreme authority! He seeks to conquer all Asia and drag billions into heresy! Will the Emperor’s majesty be shaken? Where will Asia’s fate turn? No one knows… Pray. Only faith can save you from the flames."
  china_aprilfools25.10.a: "Who needs to get the fuck out?"

  china_aprilfools25.11.t: "The Eternal Summer Camp Movement"
  china_aprilfools25.11.d: "Heaven births the myriad things to nourish humankind; humankind has nothing with which to repay Heaven."
  china_aprilfools25.11.a: "Fuck you, I hate every last one of you!!!!!!!"

  china_aprilfools25.12.t: "A Rebellion a Day"
  china_aprilfools25.12.d: "What happened? Oh, more little Uyghur bombs. They just want to wipe everyone out."
  china_aprilfools25.12.a: "The Emperor must press forward!"

  china_aprilfools25.13.t: "Because the Mountain Is There"
  china_aprilfools25.13.d: "Some say the mountain is too high, too cold; that humanity has limits and can never conquer nature. They never believed any of that. The foreman stood on the gale-raked ridge, eyes narrowed toward the distance; at his feet, a battlefield of workers and machines interlocked. Giant excavators roared as they tore the frozen earth; charges boomed deep in the rock, shuddering loose sheets of snow.\n\nThey would raise a fortress amid these Himalayan ice and stones, and that would only be one part of the project. When it is complete, the world will behold a palace—or rather a city—so vast it might swallow whole mountain ranges and plateaus, standing upon the soil of China.\n\nSome say gods dwell upon the mountain. The foreman had heard such tales, but never heeded them. Through millennia of war, famine, pain, plague—when did those so-called gods ever reach down a hand? The wind howled, laden with the grit of the site; he gave a dry laugh. Those gods don’t exist; they never have. And even if they did, they have never once looked upon humankind.\n\nThe fortress’s outline had emerged, sheer walls shouldering above the snowline. Cranes swung titanic beams skyward; sparks from welders flickered in the cold. They asked for no miracle and sought no heaven. The foreman checked his tools; he thumbed the ice from his hammer. Then he turned toward the next worksite.\n\nThere are no gods here—only human will, only the great work forged by countless hands and machines."
  china_aprilfools25.13.a: "This place should be named the “Imperial Palace of Terra.”"

  china_aprilfools25.14.t: "An Odd Affair"
  china_aprilfools25.14.d: "“Old Chen, do you think the team next door has gone collectively insane?” Li Zeming slouched in his lab chair, clutching an empty teacup. Chen Haoran shot him a glance and kept typing; the bouncing digits on his screen were the only comfort since they’d graduated Fudan.\n\n“Insane? Don’t know. But yesterday I saw Zhang Maoxin dressed like a temple abbot—red robes swishing, censer in hand.” He paused his work and started scrolling his phone.\n\nLi rubbed his temples, recalling the morning—Old Liu next door bowing to his computer, the case plastered with yellow talismans, muttering ‘Praise the Machine God’ or something. “I thought it was a joke, but before clock-in they stood in a circle chanting like a pyramid-scheme brainwash, incense smoke giving me a headache.” He shook his head; the cup clicked crisply on the desk.\n\nChen poured more hot water. “Feels like a cult. You think the project pressure cooked their brains?”\n\nAt lunch, they slung on their bags and walked out side by side. Li frowned. “The last line they chanted—gibberish. Something like ohm… aum…”"
  china_aprilfools25.14.a: "“Which ‘Messiah’ was that again?”"

  china_aprilfools25.15.t: "The Battle Flag"
  china_aprilfools25.15.d: "He stood before the reviewing stand, eyes sweeping calmly over the ranks of Space Marines. They loomed—power armor of deep green sealing them head to toe, heavy breaths muffled within their helms, low and steady.\n\nHe nodded; quiet satisfaction rose in his chest. After today, the gnawing cares—anxieties, fears, doubts—would be ground to dust. That worn cap of being mocked as backward—long since hurled to the far side of the sea.\n\nThe war-standard unfurled, crimson field setting off a golden starburst—the emblem of the People’s Liberation Army. He handed the banner to the leading warrior himself; the giant’s hand took it sure and steady, armor joints whispering with a rasp of metal.\n\n“You are the Republic’s first Chapter, and you shall be granted…”"
  china_aprilfools25.15.a: "“…the title Children of the People.”"

  china_aprilfools25.16.t: "The Future"
  china_aprilfools25.16.d: "Night lay deep. He sat in a broad wooden chair as humanity’s future churned in his mind: rot and decadence spreading like rust, the smoke of war unscattered, the shadow of disease unlifted, and the splendor of human civilization seeming to brush the brink of collapse.\n\nHe could not abide the stall. His homeland’s rivers and mountains flowed within him—his roots; the nation’s pulse beat as the rhythm of his blood. Yet deeper still was his longing for humankind, the species that once struggled through mud and yet kindled a spark. He closed his eyes; a murmur of billions seemed to whisper at his ear—pain and hope, both.\n\nHe loathed religion’s blinders, despised the decay of lechery, and hated the gnawing of guile and plague. He had seen too many souls sink, too many hopes crushed. He would not accept it. Humanity’s fate must not halt here, nor be chained forever by these fetters.\n\nHe rose and walked to the window. The cosmos flickered far off—distant, unknown—the ultimate destination. He believed that one day the species would cast off every chain and step beyond this cradle.\n\nSalvation will not fall from the sky. It will be forged—by him, by countless hands—from the ruins.\n\nHe turned back, his steps steady in the dark.\n\nThe night is long, but there is already a glow at the end."
  china_aprilfools25.16.a: "He loves the people of his homeland—and still more, the humans of this planet."

  china_aprilfools25.17.t: "The Last Hope"
  china_aprilfools25.17.d: "He sat at the center, eyes sweeping the twenty uniformed generals arrayed around him. Night had deepened beyond the windows, but the discussion within only burned hotter. Weariness crept along his spine, yet those callused hands stayed steady upon the table. Before men who bore the fate of humankind, he could not—would not—show the least weakness.\n\nMaps of nations were mirrored in his eyes. Those scattered island chains; those lands scoured by war and exploitation; those states rotted by decadence and corruption—each stood clear in his sight. All of it was rubble on humanity’s road to a new birth. He would do all he could to remove it.\n\nHe knew how history would judge him—tyrant, perhaps; or unifier. It did not matter. He held only one conviction: whatever the verdict, humanity must remember this day; remember the blood and spirit of these men; remember how foolish and fallen we once were.\n\nNow he held humanity’s future in his hands. Even if the path bristled with thorns, even if it must be stained with blood, he would not regret it."
  china_aprilfools25.17.a: "Thus the fire of the Great Crusade was lit."

  china_aprilfools25.18.t: "Mechanicus Experiment Log"
  china_aprilfools25.18.d: "ID: CN-IX-0047\nRecorder: Bio-Magos Xu Qingran\nLocation: Shenzhen Subterranean Forge-Bay\nSubject: Soft-Tissue Construct “Milk-Dragon”\n\nPer government directive, we’ve cooked up something new here in Shenzhen. The thing’s yellow all over—looks like a pile of soft tissue—but in testing it tanked fire on par with an Imperial Guard defensive line and can charge the front as a meat shield, soaking enemy fire. Odd silhouette, sure, but the utility is undeniable.\n\nIn simulated combat it withstood seventeen and a half minutes of conventional fire with minimal critical damage. On the charge it can smash open enemy ranks and cut a path for following units. We assess it as fully field-capable and aligned with operational needs.\n\nThe first batch is complete and slated for live trials in Hong Kong. If those trials show no surprises, the “Milk-Dragon” can enter mass production and be deployed worldwide as a vanguard element. On future battlefields it will be first in, breaking the foe to heel.\n\nNext we validate its combat performance. We’ll collate the data for the High Lords Council to adjudicate. Here’s hoping it stands the test—so our labor wasn’t in vain.\n\nPraise the Omnissiah aloud! All glory to the Machine-God!"
