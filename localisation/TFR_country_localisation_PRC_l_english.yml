  # Public Health: COVID-19 Measures & Policies
  # =========================
  PRC_lockdown_wuhan: "Lockdown of Wuhan"
  PRC_lockdown_wuhan_desc: "As panic spreads, the situation is slipping out of control. Since CCTV reported the discovery of a “novel contagious coronavirus,” mass outflows have begun across Hubei Province centered on Wuhan. Citizens are scrambling to flee the city; the expressways are jammed to a standstill. If we do nothing, hospitals nationwide will be reporting many more infections within days. We must act decisively and order a full lockdown of Wuhan now."
  PRC_nationwide_lockdown: "Nationwide Epidemic Controls"
  PRC_nationwide_lockdown_desc: "This will be unprecedented in public-health history—China will enter a “quasi-wartime posture” nationwide, imposing strict limits on personal travel and transport to curb viral spread. Citizens infected with coronavirus will be centrally isolated and treated in hospitals and temporary medical facilities. Meanwhile, medical and biological researchers across the country will be mobilized to pool wisdom and find a definitive solution to defeat the virus."
  PRC_implement_emergency_measures: "Enact Emergency Measures"
  PRC_implement_emergency_measures_desc: "In a national crisis, all people should stand together. Yet, as expected, unscrupulous anti-Party elements and profiteers are sowing rumors, slandering the Party and government, and sabotaging our control efforts. We will not be gentle: the People’s Police will immediately crack down on hoarding and price-gouging of medicines and masks. At the same time, tighter cyberspace controls will prevent the public from being misled and incited."
  PRC_implement_widespread_testing: "Roll Out Mass PCR Testing"
  PRC_implement_widespread_testing_desc: "PCR testing is inexpensive, easy to scale, and enables faster diagnosis of coronavirus infection—critical for timely treatment, surveillance and control, and restoring the economy and normal life. We will roll out testing nationwide and build multiple testing sites in major cities. Government personnel first; in time, all residents—and ultimately all citizens—will be tested."
  PRC_economic_stability_policy: "Economic Stabilization Policy"
  PRC_economic_stability_policy_desc: "COVID-19 has heavily disrupted normal economic order and production, seriously slowing growth—potentially undermining our goal of building a modern socialist power by mid-century. With the world struggling yet our epidemic initially contained, it is time to return the nation to the path of development and further consolidate our status as the “world’s factory.”"
  PRC_zero_covid_policy: "Uphold Zero-COVID"
  PRC_zero_covid_policy_desc: "Facing the pandemic, the Party and government have always put people’s lives and health first. For the people, we must, under the strong leadership of the Central Committee, fully uphold the zero-COVID policy. The strict early measures have proven effective. Those calling for relaxation now either fail to grasp the virus’s danger or harbor ulterior motives. We will continue to implement zero-COVID—“people first, life first.”"
  PRC_adopt_the_swedish_model: "Study the Swedish Model"
  PRC_adopt_the_swedish_model_desc: "As the first country to officially declare the pandemic over, Sweden’s policies have drawn global attention. Some of our health officials and physicians advise we study their approach: easing public-venue restrictions, halting daily case disclosures, and foregoing mandatory PCR testing for non-medical staff and low-risk groups. As transmissibility and virulence wane, this could speed our return to normal."
  PRC_kickstart_vaccine_research: "Kick-start Vaccine R&D"
  PRC_kickstart_vaccine_research_desc: "We will order national research institutes and pharmaceutical firms to immediately begin research and trials for a COVID-19 vaccine—not only to control the epidemic faster, but also to elevate our international standing and influence. Multiple candidates, including Sinovac’s inactivated vaccine, are already in clinical trials. We have also informed WHO and developing countries that we are willing to donate vaccines and cooperate on research."
  PRC_adopt_strict_lockdown_measures: "Impose Stricter Lockdowns"
  PRC_adopt_strict_lockdown_measures_desc: "Despite preparations, the virus’s transmissibility exceeds expectations. We must further tighten controls, devote more resources, and minimize internal, rural-urban, and cross-border movement. Some accuse us of “forcing a national shutdown,” but to defeat the epidemic, firm lockdowns will prove necessary."
  PRC_focus_on_vaccine_development: "Focus on Vaccine Development"
  PRC_focus_on_vaccine_development_desc: "Only by fielding a reliable vaccine can we control viral transmission at its source. Led by Sinovac and other biopharma firms, vaccine R&D has made decisive progress. We must allocate funds and resources wisely to accelerate development and deployment so that our people are ultimately protected from infection."
  PRC_focus_on_mask_production: "Prioritize Mask Production"
  PRC_focus_on_mask_production_desc: "Medical masks are inexpensive, mass-producible, and easy to distribute nationwide. Adequate mask supply is a key pillar of stabilizing the epidemic. The State Council will fund expansion of medical mask capacity—especially technical support and subsidies for manufacturers in hard-hit regions."
  PRC_food_safety_reforms: "Food-Safety Reforms"
  PRC_food_safety_reforms_desc: "Given that this unfortunate outbreak likely began with a “patient zero” consuming wild game, it is time for sweeping reform of food safety and hygiene. We will legislate to eradicate consumption of wild animals and promote hygienic table etiquette to reduce public-venue transmission. We will also invest further in industrial and convenience-food processing to make products safer and cleaner."
  PRC_surveillance_state_contact_tracing: "State-Run Contact Tracing"
  PRC_surveillance_state_contact_tracing_desc: "After the outbreak, we launched the “Health Code” location-tracking app as an e-pass and proof of health status, indicating each user’s epidemic risk level. Only with full, real-time tracking of high-risk groups under government control can we formulate effective policy while ensuring critical national-security data and citizens’ personal information are not leaked."
  PRC_outsource_contact_tracing: "Outsource Contact Tracing"
  PRC_outsource_contact_tracing_desc: "After the outbreak, we launched the “Health Code” location-tracking app as an e-pass and health-status certificate that shows personal epidemic risk. To reduce administrative burden and costs, we can entrust operations to trusted private internet companies so they share the load."
  PRC_miandian_tundi: "Intervene in Myanmar..."
  PRC_miandian_tundi_desc: "If we cannot end the war quickly, Myanmar will become a bottomless pit."
  PRC_fund_crowd_immunity_studies: "Fund Herd-Immunity Studies"
  PRC_fund_crowd_immunity_studies_desc: "As vaccination rates climb, population immunity has markedly improved. A key premise of herd immunity is that as the share of immune individuals rises, transmission chains are more easily broken and nationwide impacts fade. We will task our medical experts and major media to prepare theory and public messaging in advance of any policy pivot toward herd-immunity strategie
  
  PRC_blame_the_americans: "Turn the Question on the U.S."
  PRC_blame_the_americans_desc: "Since the full outbreak of COVID-19, Western powers led by the United States have tirelessly pushed the term “Wuhan virus” and demanded that we “compensate” for their losses. Now the tables have turned: the Fort Detrick (Maryland) biolab has been spotlighted, and many citizens in both countries are questioning whether it is connected to the pandemic—even launching open letters. We can seize this moment to ask the U.S. government why it continues to obfuscate."

  PRC_blame_local_officials: "Hold Local Officials Accountable"
  PRC_blame_local_officials_desc: "At the onset of the outbreak, some local governments papered over risks to protect their performance records, leaving us unprepared when the epidemic hit. We now see that certain cadres “report only good news.” The CCDI will comprehensively audit the past years’ work and documents of all levels of government, focusing on punishing local officials who were lax in implementing central policy or maintained improper ties with pharmaceutical firms."

  PRC_expand_the_social_safety_net: "Expand the Social Safety Net"
  PRC_expand_the_social_safety_net_desc: "The epidemic offered a sobering lesson. Many who died were impoverished and socially isolated, especially the elderly, in both rural and urban areas—exposing shortcomings in our social security system. To realize common prosperity, we must craft a more complete safety net that provides timely support for those in need."

  PRC_return_to_normalcy: "Return to Normalcy"
  PRC_return_to_normalcy_desc: "After years of effort, today we can announce to our people and the world: China has emerged from the era of the COVID-19 pandemic and officially returned to normal. This is not only a victory for the CPC and the PRC, but also a great triumph achieved by 1.4 billion Chinese people!"

  PRC_control_the_oil_crisis: "Contain the Oil Crisis"
  PRC_control_the_oil_crisis_desc: "A sudden oil crisis has hit our economy hard. Stocks plunged within a week, panic exceeded worst-case expectations, many companies collapsed, and foreign capital began weighing exit risks. Our vaunted transport system has stalled for lack of fuel. The Party has ordered immediate economic repair—yet where to start remains a tangle."

  PRC_crack_down_on_left_radicals: "Crack Down on Ultra-Left Radicals"
  PRC_crack_down_on_left_radicals_desc: "Predictably, opposition forces are exploiting the crisis to pressure Party leadership for reforms and power concessions. Long-time critics of reform and opening—ultra-left radicals including retired cadres, academics, and disaffected youth—are clamoring for a return to Mao-era egalitarianism and denouncing the current “revisionist” line. Measures are required."

  PRC_crack_down_on_reformist_protesters: "Crack Down on Reformist Protesters"
  PRC_crack_down_on_reformist_protesters_desc: "Predictably, opposition forces are exploiting the crisis to pressure Party leadership for reforms and power concessions. Many capitalists publicly claim excessive state intervention and crackdowns on private enterprise caused the collapse—echoed by intra-Party reformists and young intellectuals. They must learn to hold their tongues."

  PRC_empower_the_50_cent_army: "Safeguard the Online Environment"
  PRC_empower_the_50_cent_army_desc: "Online commenters who often voice support for the Party and government are popularly nicknamed “50-centers,” implying they praise authorities for trifling pay. Regardless, they play a key role in guiding online discourse. In times of opinion crises, this tactic has proven effective—and this time is no exception."

  PRC_concessions_to_corporate_demands: "Concessions to Business"
  PRC_concessions_to_corporate_demands_desc: "The Party’s governance capacity faces a stern test. If business discontent grows, development cannot be assured. We will make measured concessions: pro-business policies such as tax cuts and debt relief, and curbing online vilification of entrepreneurs. Without enterprise-driven GDP, China cannot be a superpower."

  PRC_concessions_to_populist_demands: "Nationalist Messaging"
  PRC_concessions_to_populist_demands_desc: "The Party’s governance capacity faces a stern test. If popular discontent grows, stability cannot be assured. We will make measured concessions by permitting certain protests and demonstrations as outlets for grievance. After all, nationalist and populist slogans cost us little."

  PRC_stabilize_the_political_sphere: "Stabilize the Political Sphere"
  PRC_stabilize_the_political_sphere_desc: "Though dissent has not vanished, we have broadly stabilized the political landscape, ensured majority support for the Party and the General Secretary, and accommodated key intra-Party factions and interest groups. This lays a solid foundation for our next steps."

  PRC_contain_the_damage: "Contain the Damage"
  PRC_contain_the_damage_desc: "Securing domestic stability first will allow us to pursue reforms more effectively to weather the oil crisis and restore national strength. China has never needed unity and strong leadership more than today."

  PRC_a_broken_system: "A Broken System"
  PRC_a_broken_system_desc: "We must admit the oil shock has exposed the current system’s shortcomings and fragility. Extraordinary times call for strong medicine: embrace bolder reforms and cut deep into outdated structures. Only then can true national rejuvenation follow."

  PRC_expand_domestic_oil_production: "Expand Domestic Oil Production"
  PRC_expand_domestic_oil_production_desc: "In this perilous moment, we cannot rely on unstable import routes. We will further tap domestic reserves and build more drilling and refining capacity. Energy security must be in our own hands; shorter logistics will also lower costs and soften the crisis’s blow."

  PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade: "Diversify Oil Trade"
  PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade_desc: "With major producing regions in turmoil, securing stable import channels is vital. Thanks to long-standing ties with developing nations, we can open additional routes—e.g., imports from Venezuela and Brunei—to spread risk."

  PRC_drill_for_xinjiang_oil: "Drill Xinjiang Oil"
  PRC_drill_for_xinjiang_oil_desc: "Xinjiang’s vast lands have hosted oil extraction for years, but remoteness and sparse population limited effective utilization. Now, with rapid approval of pipelines and new extraction contracts, Xinjiang oil has become a lifeline for our economy."

  PRC_south_china_sea_expansion: "Stabilize the South China Sea"
  PRC_south_china_sea_expansion_desc: "The South China Sea holds abundant energy reserves—enough to carry us through the crisis. We should intensify exploration and development there to ease our immediate strain while maintaining regional stability."
  
  PRC_synthetic_oil_investments: "Invest in Synthetic Oil"
  PRC_synthetic_oil_investments_desc: "In the current shortage, synthetic petroleum looks attractive. For us, it is relatively low-cost, can be produced quickly at scale, and offers performance comparable to conventional oil. Though stability issues remain, synthetic fuels have already become the primary energy source for many plants along the eastern seaboard—and adoption is spreading."

  PRC_gambit_in_the_gulf: "Gambit in the Gulf"
  PRC_gambit_in_the_gulf_desc: "To solve a problem, address its roots. We will deepen our presence in the Gulf region and more proactively safeguard our core interests there. By engaging regional governments directly and providing support to stabilize local conditions, we aim to end the crisis’s negative impacts on oil supply."

  PRC_stabilize_the_economic_sphere: "Stabilize the Economy"
  PRC_stabilize_the_economic_sphere_desc: "We can blunt the oil shock through multiple tools: limit fuel price growth, issue fuel vouchers to curb inventory drawdown, and deliver relief funds and bonds to hard-hit areas to arrest contraction. A package of coordinated measures will demonstrate our capacity to steady the economy."

  PRC_southeast_asian_bailout_package: "Southeast Asia Relief Package"
  PRC_southeast_asian_bailout_package_desc: "With smaller reserves and weaker economies, Southeast Asian nations saw sharp downturns as the oil crisis began. We can expand our influence with ASEAN by boosting trade and support to stabilize their economies and politics—projecting the image of a responsible major power."

We will spotlight model citizens to strengthen patriotic pride among the masses."

  PRC_rejuvinate_the_nation: "Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation"
  PRC_rejuvinate_the_nation_desc: "We are emerging from the oil crisis’s shadow: growth is returning, foreign reserves stabilizing, and investors are coming back. Renewed prospects and rising national pride prove once more that no hardship can defeat the Chinese people. National rejuvenation is within reach."

  PRC_a_renewable_revolution: "A Renewable Revolution"
  PRC_a_renewable_revolution_desc: "We cannot rely solely on restored oil imports. Fortuitously, rapid advances let us better harness wind and solar to offset losses from oil shortages. Wider adoption will also cut pollution and create jobs."

  PRC_a_nuclear_revolution: "A Nuclear Revolution"
  PRC_a_nuclear_revolution_desc: "Our economists and scientists advise stepping up investment in nuclear power to drive industry and the broader economy. Some raise safety and environmental concerns—but at a critical moment, wavering is not an option."

  PRC_shake_up_the_politburo_desc: "Through sustained effort under Party leadership and unity among all ethnic groups, we achieved decisive victories against COVID-19, the oil crisis, and power-sector reforms. With lives and livelihoods secured—and as U.S. turmoil deepens—this is a moment for bold strategy. Convene the 6th Plenum to review gains and chart major policies ahead."

  # =========================
  # Taiwan Strait Campaign
  # =========================
  PRC_the_final_opportunity: "The Final Opportunity"
  PRC_the_final_opportunity_desc: "After more than seven decades of stalemate, U.S. domestic turmoil has removed the largest obstacle to national reunification. Though Japan and others claim they will “maintain the status quo,” their economies and militaries cannot match ours—and without U.S. leadership, coordination is doubtful. This is the best—and perhaps last—moment to begin the liberation of Taiwan."

  PRC_blockade_taiwan: "Blockade Taiwan"
  PRC_blockade_taiwan_desc: "We will declare exclusion zones around the island and deploy escorts and submarines to patrol designated boundaries day and night. Air routes to Taiwan will be tightly monitored. This clears civilian interference for our operations, severs the island’s economic lifelines, and erodes the authorities’ grip. Some will decry a “humanitarian crisis,” but once the island collapses, the conflict will end swiftly."

  PRC_operation_silent_dawn: "§YSilent Dawn Operation§!"
  PRC_operation_silent_dawn_desc: "The decisive moment has come. We will launch Silent Dawn, a crucial step for campaign success. Rocket Force ballistic missiles and rocket artillery will preemptively strike Taiwan’s key military targets—airfields, SAM sites, and radar—to break early warning. Power plants, substations, and major communications hubs will also be targeted."

  PRC_plan_on_high_alert: "PLAN on High Alert"
  PRC_plan_on_high_alert_desc: "Since initiating blockade and patrols, the Navy’s critical tasks include thwarting breakout attempts by Taiwan’s fleet and countering harassment by hostile forces such as the U.S. 7th Fleet and JMSDF. The Coast Guard likewise plays a vital role, intercepting multiple attempts by merchant and refugee vessels to run the line."

  PRC_plaaf_on_high_alert: "PLAAF Combat Air Patrols"

  PRC_finish_what_mao_started_desc: "After 1949 a famous slogan vowed to “plant the flag of victory on Taiwan.” Yet by 1976, Chairman Mao did not see reunification. With today’s shifting world and no U.S. interference, the People’s Liberation Army will cross the Strait and liberate all China."

  PRC_final_offensive: "The Final Offensive"
  PRC_final_offensive_desc: "After protracted fighting, we have encircled the island’s last significant forces within the Taipei metro. Guerrillas linger in the mountains, but taking Taipei will end hostilities. The People’s Liberation Army will conclude the War of Liberation—begun June 26, 1946—and China will be fully unified."
  
  PRC_unite_people: "Unite the Masses"
  PRC_unite_people_desc: "Beyond rooting out hostile elements hidden among the people, we will mobilize the masses to actively conduct counter-espionage. At the same time, to demonstrate the advantages of socialism and build identification with the new order, we will launch extensive aid and reconstruction for Taiwan, offer preferential policies for local residents, and encourage prompt application for PRC ID documents.\n\nRemember the soldiers’ creed; love the people wherever you go.\n\nDefend the motherland and press ever forward—welcomed and supported by all the people!"

  PRC_eight_points: "Eight Points for Attention"
  PRC_eight_points_desc: "Speak politely; trade fairly; return what you borrow; compensate for damage; do not hit or abuse; do not harm crops; do not harass women; do not mistreat prisoners.\n\nIn this final campaign, our conduct must be exemplary.

  PRC_utilize_xinjiang_methods: "Apply the Xinjiang Governance Package"
  PRC_utilize_xinjiang_methods_desc: "To restore stability swiftly, some advocate replicating measures used in Xinjiang: deploying a large peacekeeping/CT presence, enforcing strict public-security controls, and curfews in hotspots. This proposal is backed mainly by hardliners, senior officers, and security chiefs."

  PRC_one_china_two_systems: "One Country, Two Systems"
  PRC_one_china_two_systems_desc: "Others favor the Hong Kong/Macau template—rapidly establishing ‘One Country, Two Systems’ for Taiwan, transferring authority to a newly elected local government while gradually withdrawing PLA and PAP units. This aligns with long-standing commitments and is supported by moderates, diplomats, and civil administrators."

  PRC_gradual_stabilization: "Gradual Stabilization"
  PRC_gradual_stabilization_desc: "Through sustained effort, stability has broadly returned. Residents are venturing out, commerce and transit are resuming. Lingering resentment may persist, but this outcome is a remarkable success."

  PRC_unify_the_bureacracy: "Unify the Bureaucracy"
  PRC_unify_the_bureacracy_desc: "Lasting prosperity requires a reliable civil service.

  PRC_expand_the_blacklist_system: "Expand the Blacklist Regime"
  PRC_expand_the_blacklist_system_desc: "Leveraging big data from the social-credit system, we will catalogue the untrustworthy: not only debt evaders and local thugs, but also hostile foreign operatives and online agitators. In time, the digital tide will enable a more honest, orderly society."

  PRC_peoples_social_credit: "National Civic Information System"
  PRC_peoples_social_credit_desc: "Social credit will underpin a healthy, ethical, and harmonious society while safeguarding personal data.

As global warming becomes a shared challenge for all nations and rising seas threaten to inundate cities like Shanghai and Tianjin, the state has begun moving toward greener, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly policies. Yet the road to a beautiful green future remains long and arduous. We must show the resolve to ‘cut off a festering limb to save the body,’ letting go of extensive, backward, high-energy-consuming industries that once drove growth, while pushing supply-side structural reform and environmental policy reform.

  PRC_taiwan_war_cat: "War in the Taiwan Strait"
  PRC_taiwan_war_cat_desc: "Seventy years have flashed by, yet our national map still bears a gap. When the People’s Liberation Army liberated all of China in 1949, the craven Kuomintang reactionaries fled to the island of Taiwan. The two twins—the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China—were separated by the Strait and developed apart. Over time, Western influence quietly seeped in, luring the people of Taiwan to forsake their roots and to craft a separate identity. But a tree without roots cannot live; division cannot last forever. Now, with the United States plunged into chaos, the coming war will decide whether we can fulfill our historic mission and bring a long-divided motherland back into one."
