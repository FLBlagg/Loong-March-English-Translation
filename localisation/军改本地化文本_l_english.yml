Its entire combat power at birth amounted to a single outdated reconnaissance aircraft—the “Lenin.” During the War of Resistance against Japan and the Liberation War, the PLA suffered continually from a lack of air superiority. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, facing the world’s strongest military, PLA troops had to press attacks under the fire of enemy bombers. All this changed with Soviet aid: large numbers of advanced MiG fighters were delivered to the people’s army. As one PLA ace after another emerged, the U.S. military was shocked to find that this nearly newborn air force could inflict heavy losses.\nA peak at birth, the PLAAF continued to guard the Republic’s airspace through the Cold War. Even after the Cold War ended—flying outdated 3rd-generation and early 4th-generation aircraft—the PLAAF never retreated, standing as a shield for the motherland.\nOver the past decade, as the J-16, J-20, and J-35 entered service, the world began to take the PLAAF’s rapid development seriously.

  prc_military.1.d: "“Auntie, we’ll sleep outside. Regulations say we can’t go indoors,” the soldiers called out, voices firm, eyes unwavering in their discipline.\n\n“Oh you poor kids,” the old woman fussed, heart aching. “Grandson, bring out the cardboard—lay it for the soldiers so they aren’t on bare ground. They’re just youngsters; sleeping on the floor will ruin their backs. And it’s so late—you must be hungry. We haven’t got anything fancy, just thin porridge. I’ll put a pot on now. Grandson, run to the shop and fetch the steamed rice cakes we ordered—can’t let our lads go hungry into the fireline.” She moved with quick, practiced hands, as if these men were her very own sons.\n\n“Bohai, go help Auntie with the porridge—she’s elderly; don’t let her overexert herself. Everyone else, rest where you are. Once you’ve had a breather, we move on to the fire,” the squad leader said—gentle, steady, balancing respect for the old woman with the need to give his troops a moment’s respite.\n\n“Young man, how old are you—twenty-four? You’re the very image…” She squinted up at him, memories flooding back. “When I was in my twenties I met soldiers your age. Like you, each wore a red star above his brow, and like you they wouldn’t step into my house—said it was against discipline. One of them—so solemn—recited a poem by Chairman Mao to prove it. Seventy-four years have passed; I’m an old crone now, but I never forgot that poem…”\n\nShe sat on her little stool, gaze soft and faraway, telling of years gone by. That poem only shines brighter across the river of time—like the bond she’s never stopped feeling for the People’s Soldiers."

  prc_military.2.a: "For victory, we march on forever!"
  prc_military.2.t: "Unity, Tension, Seriousness, Liveliness"
  prc_military.2.d: "These eight characters—first set forth by the Central Committee in Yan’an as the motto of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (Kangda)—have been passed down to this day. Even now they define the Party’s and the Army’s fine conduct. Tempered by this spirit, a force arose that does not fall, cannot be crushed, and will not be defeated.\n\nAcross its long history, everything about the People’s Army—its personnel, equipment, and doctrine—has undergone immense change. Yet one thing has not: the PLA’s fine conduct—Unity, Tension, Seriousness, Liveliness.\n\nToday, Kangda’s old campus sleeps quietly in Yan’an. Its mission as a university ended long ago, but its spirit still flows in the blood of the People’s Army. Without grasping that spirit, how could one answer: why did the PLA dare to fight—and prevail—even when outmatched and ill-equipped? Because our soldiers possess iron will—and it is that will which forged our great People’s Army.\n\nEven in peacetime, storms gather. However strong the nation grows, the PLA will not slacken. We do not love war, and we do not fear it. Should the Chinese nation once more face its most perilous hour, a new generation of soldiers will, like their forebears eighty years ago, raise walls of flesh and steel to guard home and country. Every officer and enlisted man understands that when that day truly comes—"

In the big lecture later I’ll have you stand the whole time! Or I’ll ask the political instructor to put it on your record, then you can go home and sleep to your heart’s content!”\n\nAnother big lecture. Dozing off during lectures had almost become a habit. His fifth year now; he’d taken part in missions big and small, and seen batch after batch of comrades rotate out. He was a “big brother” to the two-year conscripts, a squad leader—yet still, he felt lost.\n\nShould I demobilize this year? he wondered…\n\nThe sting of medicated balm snapped him back. “Enough—dab a little and wake up. We train after class. You’re the squad leader—set the example for the rookies.”\n\n“Roger!”\n\nOnce the battalion settled, the political instructor came in, cleared his throat, and began: “Comrades, to convey higher authority’s directive, today we start with a chapter of military history—the Zunyi Conference…”\n\nAs the commissar spoke, Lao Ye drifted over his years in the force: he’d joined just as the reforms hit; the NCOs who were cut cursed Bo Xilai day and night. After two or three years of neglect for the People’s Armed Police, he himself had muttered ‘damned Bo Xilai.’\n\n“At the Second Zunyi Conference, Chairman Xi emphasized the Party Center and the Central Military Commission’s absolute leadership over the People’s Army…”\n\nHe thought of the elder statesman—at the National Stadium (the “Bird’s Nest”), the Party History Museum, Tiananmen, the Xiong’an New Area inauguration—he’d been on security details not far from him; once within ten meters.\n\nIt gave him a strange feeling—made him think of another great predecessor… Since Xi took office, he’d watched his backwater hometown—once served by a single express train—become a regional artery. His family had weathered the pandemic in safety. He glanced at the first- and second-years listening intently, then at his co-year deputy squad leader, and whispered, “Another three years?”\n\nHis mate rolled his eyes, joking: “Put me on the National Day parade guard, or no deal.”\n\n“Done. The next credit’s mine anyway.”\n\nOn the way back, gazing at the flag snapping high above, he began to sing with pride:"

  prc_military.4.t: "The Third Gutian Conference"
  prc_military.4.d: "Outside the old Gutian site, PLA honor guards stood taut, eyes sweeping the approaches. Inside, senior commanders had taken their seats: Army Commander Li Qiaoming; Air Force Commander Chang Dingqiu; Navy Commander Dong Jun; CMC members Li Zuocheng and Liu Zhenli; CMC Vice Chairmen Zhang Youxia and He Weidong; and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Xi Jinping.\n\nAll were men of hard-won merit—Li Zuocheng, Zhang Youxia, Liu Zhenli, and Li Qiaoming had fought in the Self-Defense Counterattack Against Vietnam and the Two Mountains Campaign; He Weidong, Chang Dingqiu, and Dong Jun had led key phases of the Taiwan Strait campaign.\n\n“Comrades,” Xi began, “you all know how chaotic the international situation is. In Europe, NATO and Russia are on a knife-edge. America is mired in civil war—years on, still a boiling mess. Here in the Asia–Pacific, Japan, India, Australia, and New Zealand want a new Cold War with us.” He paused. “It truly is a great change unseen in a century. We should be sober: a hot war in Asia—indeed a world war—is close at hand.”\n\n“Though the liberation of Taiwan was a rout,” General Zhang Youxia took up the thread, “many problems surfaced. Our Marine first wave made the beach in textbook fashion, but the follow-on deployment of heavy combined-arms brigades was still too slow.”\n\n“The Air Force had issues as well,” said Chang Dingqiu. “We seized air superiority across the theater thanks to a generation’s edge and pilot experience—but close air support for ground forces was not responsive enough. With timely support we could have reduced avoidable casualties.”\n\n“Our carrier groups performed well in sea denial,” Dong Jun reported, “but we still lack experience in blue-water combat.”\n\n“And for an all-out hot war with the entire PDTO,” He Weidong added, “logistics will be a major challenge—especially against Australia. We would be sustaining across the breadth of the Indo–Pacific. We’ve yet to exercise that scale of support.”\n\n“We must also attend to lift,” Li Zuocheng noted, pen scratching. “Given the global picture, we need the capability to project power worldwide—surpassing the U.S. in global deployment.”\n\nXi jotted down the points, then looked up, gaze sweeping the room.\n\n“If there are no objections, I’ll announce it here,” he said, closing his notebook. “We begin the second round of comprehensive military reform.”\n\nThe generals rose as one and saluted the Chairman: “We guarantee to fulfill the mission entrusted by the Party and the people!”"

  prc_military.5.a: "Let Mao Zedong’s banner fly high!"
  prc_military.5.t: "PLA Reform Begins!"
  prc_military.5.d: "‘Military reform’ is no stranger in the PLA’s chronicles. The first systematic reform traces to the Sanwan Reorganisation after the Autumn Harvest Uprising, when Chairman Mao, against strong opposition, placed Party branches down to the company level—instituting officer–soldier equality and the mass line. At the first Gutian Conference, the guidelines of building the Army through ideology and politics were formally established.\n\nBone set at Sanwan, soul cast at Gutian: the true People’s Army was born—and in blood and fire it defeated all enemies and liberated all of China.\n\nIn the reform-and-opening era, fiscal strain pushed Comrade Deng Xiaoping to open the Pandora’s box of allowing the Army to “do business” to sustain defense budgets—never a long-term solution. Comrade Jiang Zemin then spent a decade rooting out the consequences of military commercialism.\n\nIn 2014, Chairman Xi convened the Second Gutian Conference, launching the first large-scale reform of the new millennium: to build an informatized, combined-arms force; to overhaul the command architecture; to establish the Joint Staff Department; to stand up the Rocket Force and the Strategic Support Force; to replace military regions with theater commands. This sweeping reform forged a modern, advanced PLA—and it was tested in combat across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAs *Flames Ascendant* spreads and the world shifts, the Taiwan campaign exposed many shortcomings. The People’s Army needs a new round of reform to meet even more complex future wars.\n\nBut whatever changes, one thing will never fade: that vivid red—and the thought that animates it."

Some foolish frogs at the bottom of a well still shout “copycat” and “knock-off,” claiming our aircraft will fall apart like paper planes in real combat—but no serious analyst dares take the PLAAF lightly.\n\nIn the Taiwan campaign, the PLAAF—through superiority in equipment and personnel—annihilated the puppet air force with ease. Japanese fighters loitering over Okinawa to intervene never dared cross the line under the shadow of our electronic warfare fleet and J-20s.\n\nWith the United States consumed by civil war, the PLAAF has become, beyond dispute, the world’s premier air arm. Yet we cannot grow complacent: State Security confirms that even as Japan mass-produces F-35s, it is also pushing a so-called “5.5-generation” fighter—the *Shinshin* (ATD-X). To sustain comprehensive advantage over the PDTO, we have further increased investment in air-power R&D.\n\nAviation Industry Corporation of China reports multiple program breakthroughs. It is time to design a new, future air-combat architecture around these advances.\n\nThis time, we will lead the world by a generation!"

He had run countless simulated radar trials for this behemoth—but this was different: the first time the world would see the most powerful AEW&C aircraft ever built do its work for real.\n\n“Begin test.” The base commander’s order came through his headset. Li brought the radar online; the three AESA faces swept the sky. “Radar returns detected; analysis confirms low-RCS targets at a range of…” He rattled off the figures to the crew, inwardly astonished: the system really could pick stealth targets directly at long range in a complex EW environment. With the KJ-500 he’d flown before, you needed multiple orbits in concert to approach this performance. But the KJ-3000 could detect fifth-gen fighters as soon as they crossed into radar line-of-sight—punching clean through the stealth advantage.\n\nHe couldn’t help the wicked grin creeping across his face. “You fifth-gen hotshots who love to run ‘penetrating air superiority’ in every exercise—scaring us half to death—this time our AEW&C is going to make your ‘mosaic warfare’ transparent again.”"

The Eastern Theater Command had planned a special operation to hoover up JASDF radar signatures. For this task, the headquarters pulled a slice of theater J-16Ds, the carrier *Jiangsu*’s J-15Ds, and a KJ-600; crews had trained specifically for the mission.\n\nAboard J-16D no. 63771, the EW officer Li Hua lounged in the back seat—no work for him during the first leg. All he could do was stare at the HUD overlay of the East China Sea radar map he’d long since memorized. “Grey Wolf, Sawtooth Shark, this is Tianshan. You’re about to enter the mission box; execute per plan.” The AEW&C controller’s voice finally came over the net. Per their brief, they would generate false targets while collecting the adversary’s emissions and pushing them over the link—then leave the rest to the strike packages holding over the sea.\n\n“Tianshan, Grey Wolf 02 copies—commencing Blue Shield.” 63771 rolled; the formation turned. Li sat up, brought the pods to life, and the aircraft began generating multi-source deception to flood JASDF radars with phantom tracks. They were fully kitted today—even carrying jammers tailored to low-frequency anti-stealth radars. Minutes after the pods spun up, the AEW&C datalink updated the air picture: F-15Js of the JASDF Western Air Defense Sector were airborne, afterburners lit toward the false target clusters. A forest of SAM search and fire-control radars also came up at full power, sweeping for missiles that did not exist. 63771’s wingtip receivers scooped up every last watt.\n\nWith Japan’s emissions laid bare, Grey Wolf and Sawtooth Shark turned west for home. JASDF fighters screamed on toward ghosts—only cottoning on an hour later. Monitoring the open band, Li heard a chorus of “bakayarō!” explode across the net and burst out laughing—like some over-the-top anime villain."

  prc_military.104.d: "The sky was a vault of blue over a silent wilderness. In a hangar at the flight-test base, an old man sat alone.\n\nNinety-five-year-old Wang Lijun had lost count of how many decades he’d worked at the South Institute. For twenty years his wife—once his lab partner—had urged him to retire and leave the “remaining tasks” to his students. He always answered with the line his protégés now treated as a maxim: There is no end to research—there is no “remaining task.” Age no longer allowed the long hours of intense calculation and deep thought of his youth, but he still held the front line, giving everything he had left to the nation’s science.\n\nTo steady his restless thoughts, Wang drew from his pocket a photo of Chairman Mao visiting Chengdu Aircraft, and his mind drifted. Once, the People’s Air Force was weak; the people lived in fear of Nationalist bombers. In Korea, our troops were pinned by American B-29s. Over the South China Sea, Martyr Wang Wei gave his life to drive off an American jet… Such bitter humiliation was the fire that kept Wang to his path. Our fifth-generation fighters stood with the best in the world now—yet his sense of urgency never eased. Until China’s airpower stood at the absolute summit, he would not stop.\n\n“Master.” The hoarse, affectionate call pulled him back. Before him stood generations of his students—silver-haired veterans and keen young talents—half the pillars of the Republic’s aviation enterprise.\n\n“A message from the tower,” one of them said. “Weather is good. We can fly.”\n\n“Good!” Life surged back into Wang’s frame. He gently pushed aside his wife’s supporting hand, braced on the table, rose, and called to the ground crew and test pilot, “Comrades, run the cold-start checklist. Prepare for first flight.”\n\nAfter a crisp flurry of activity, the vast hangar doors rolled open. Bathed in the noonday sun, the sixth-generation fighter—every soul in the shop’s sweat and tears made metal—glided onto the tarmac. Wang grabbed the radio from the table and keyed the switch.\n\n“Pre-taxi checks.” “Complete.”\n“Systems checks.” “Complete.”\n“Pre-takeoff checks.” “Engines nominal, flight-control system normal, takeoff configuration set.”\n\n“Checks complete.

Though all looked good, a first flight is never a success until the aircraft’s wheels are firmly back on the ground.\n\nThe short pattern went quickly. The moment of truth had come.\n\n“Pre-landing checks.” “VLS comms nominal; drag rudders respond; flaps deploy—normal.”\n\nWhen the aircraft rolled to a stop, the bustling hangar fell silent in an instant.\n\n“Report to all hands: the new aircraft has completed first flight!”\n\nThe test pilot’s voice—thrilled and proud—was the spark.

His sight was blurred; tears—hot and unending—slipped from the corners of his wrinkled eyes.\n\n“What… what happened to me?” He tried to ask, but all that came out were choking sobs.\n\n“Teacher, are you all right?”\n\nA student dabbed away his tears, worried. “The day we succeeded, you lost consciousness—head bowed—murmuring, ‘Chairman… Chairman…’”\n\n“Chairman…” Wang looked to his hand. He still clutched the photograph of Mao—but a broad swath of it was soaked with his tears."

Quickly!”\n\n“I’m here!” The youngest engineer on the team hurried in. Before he could bow a greeting, the old man seized his right hand.\n\n“Teacher, you—”\n\nSomething was pushed into his palm. He looked down. Not the black-and-white photo he so often saw—but a color print.\n\n“Is this… Martyr Wang Wei’s *Unfulfilled Wish*?” he asked, staring at the sky and fighter in the picture, astonished.\n\n“The world belongs to you, and to us—but in the final analysis, it belongs to you…” Wang’s voice broke again. His trembling right hand fished out a ballpoint pen and he scrawled a great “7” across the photo. Then, with eyes clouded and bloodshot yet steadfast, he fixed Li with his gaze.\n\n“I understand, Teacher.” Li looked down at the picture; his own clear eyes were rimmed with tears now.

The way he’s ‘turkey-shooting’ doesn’t look like a newbie. Old Zhang—were you this good at his age?”\n\nZhang snorted. “No. Back then the best I could manage was a 70–30 against you lot before Teacher Wang came down himself and wiped the floor with us.”\n\nAfter the sim ended, Trainee Zhou was waved over.\n\n“Anyone in your family fly?” Zhang asked—rarely with a hint of a smile. “That beautifully executed Thach Weave with your drone wingman looked awfully practiced.”\n\n“No, sir.

The only way to reach the village was radio—and fortunately a ham in the village had put out a distress call on a handheld. Local emergency teams were hacking a path toward the stricken area.\n\nReports so far said there were no casualties in the village. The only pressing problem was drinking water running out. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force scrambled, ferrying Second Lieutenant Deng and his bird to the nearest emergency airstrip by the village.\n\nThe UAV’s slung load of bottled water would sustain the villagers for more than 72 hours—well past the rescue team’s estimated arrival time.\n\nBefore long, Lt. Deng picked out his mark: three signal fires and smoke plumes rising from the village square—perfect for cueing the airdrop.\n\nAim. Release. The airframe bobbed up as the payload came off, and the supply crate’s parachute blossomed like a perfect flower.\n\nA voice came over the radio: “Xiao Zheng, nicely done. The village Party secretary is organizing the emergency party detachment to distribute the water. You can RTB.”\n\nZheng let out a long breath. Through the UAV’s EO turret he gazed at the distant snow-capped range—then a thought struck him: if, one day, this payload were swapped for certain ‘nifty little gadgets’ and dropped on the folks across Pangong Lake, would it feel any different in the hands than today’s bottled-water airdrop?"

Before long, Vice Chairmen of the CMC Zhang Youxia and He Weidong—the two “acceptance inspectors”—arrived in a well-guarded Dongfeng Mengshi.\n\n“Welcome, Comrades Zhang Youxia and He Weidong, to inspect and certify the Air Force reform work!” As the two stepped out, the directing generals for the exercise—Yi Xiaoguang and Chang Dingqiu—strode up and snapped crisp salutes.\n\n“Thank you for your hard work— and the Air Force’s as well.” Zhang and He returned the salute, then shrugged off their greatcoats to aides. Four big hands met in a firm clasp.\n\n“These weeks have been rough on you,” Zhang grinned. “Keeping up daily duties while prepping an exercise—no time to breathe, eh?”\n\n“I keep telling Dingqiu, if only we had the art of splitting into two,” Yi joked. “I’m the lucky one—he’s been sprinting between briefing rooms and ranges for days. Told me the other day he’d blistered his whole mouth from the pace.”\n\n“Much appreciated,” He laughed. “Then let the Air Force give us a show.

The GX-11 then pushed the coordinates of the ‘enemy Patriot SAM’ sites over the link to the waiting unmanned swarms. A heterogeneous mass of recon-strike UAVs and loitering munitions, guided by swarm algorithms, howled toward their marks. In the rush to power up, Red’s SAM radars were smothered by J-16D jamming—then swatted by anti-radiation missiles. As the SAM belts suffered annihilating strikes, the ‘enemy’ forward airfields took anti-runway munitions and lost operating capacity.\n\n“Enemy aviation and area air-defense capability suppressed. End exercise.”\n\nApplause and cheers broke across the ops floor. Zhang Youxia and He Weidong rose smiling, passed their notes to aides, and gripped the two generals’ hands.\n\n“Good.

  prc_military.112.t: "PLAAF Reform Complete!"
  prc_military.112.d: "The People’s Air Force’s birthmark was 1930: an old biplane reconnaissance craft, the *Lenin*, carrying the people’s soldiers into the blue for the first time. From there, a legend was written. Over Korea, fledgling PLAAF pilots shocked the world facing down an overbearing USAF. Through the Cold War’s iron curtain, the PLAAF guarded the Republic’s airspace, downing Taiwan’s fighters and spy planes.\n\nBut valor and honor cannot make up for obsolete arms. At the dawn of the 21st century the PLAAF’s mainstays were the aging J-7 and J-8. With the first flights of the J-10, J-11, and J-20, China proved it could design and build world-class advanced fighters. As the J-16, J-16D, KJ-500, J-35 and other cutting-edge types entered service, the PLAAF became the world’s second most powerful air arm.\n\nNow, with the latest reform complete, the PLAAF fields the most advanced force aloft anywhere: sixth-gen J-36s alongside fifth-gen J-20s guarantee air superiority; J-16D, GX-11, the Divine Eagle AEW UAV, and the KJ-3000 together seize command of the electromagnetic spectrum—leaving even stealth aircraft nowhere to hide. At sea, sixth-gen carrier fighter J-50s with J-15Ds and KJ-600s form a carrier air wing unmatched for breadth and depth. Dark Sword and Twin-Tailed Scorpion UAVs can loiter day and night to pour fast, heavy support on behalf of the Army. And the PLAAF now wields true long-range strategic strike and penetration.\n\nAt last, we can say with pride: the People’s Liberation Army Air Force is the strongest air force on Earth!"

With all checks complete, the yellow shirt crouched, half-turned clear of the stroke, and flashed the classic launch signal. Throttles to the stops; the EMALS hurled the jet skyward. Overhead, a KJ-600 kept wary watch on the simulated JMSDF surface group, marshalling the fresh launches into formation and pushing them toward the training box. Veterans held an overhead stack, watching each fledgling climb, join, and depart—then slid in to shepherd them to the range.\n\nSince the reform began, the Navy has expanded pilot accessions and deck-qual cycles at scale.

  prc_military.303.d: "From the Somme in the First World War, to the armored thrusts through France, to Kursk’s steel clash, tanks have shaped modern battlefields.\n\nThe PLA’s own story with armor is bittersweet: in the Anti-Japanese War, lacking tanks and AT guns, even obsolete enemy light tanks vexed us. In the Civil War, armored units—epitomized by the “Gongchen” tank—shone and opened a new chapter of PLA armored warfare.\n\nAs the global security climate shifts, so do battlefield demands. Our current ZTZ-99A/B fleet no longer suffices—we need a faster MBT with advanced datalinks, full digitization, and robust counter-UAS tools.\n\nThe CMC Equipment Development Department has drafted a design that meets Army requirements, and the Baotou plant is now rushing the prototype toward trials."

  prc_military.304.d: "A batch of new “Mountain Cat” all-terrain vehicles arrived in Beijing.\n\nHearing the news, General Zhang Youxia headed to the test track early. He loved the new variant with fixed grenade launchers and insisted on a ride. To probe the suspension, he ordered his aide to go full speed over obstacles. The aide, worried about breaking kit—and about jostling the Vice-Chairman—held back. Finding it tame, Zhang swapped seats and drove himself. The Mountain Cat ripped around the course for kilometers—right past a veteran MP.\n\nThe old MP fumed. Spotting a junior MP who’d been watching, he barked, “Why didn’t you stop that driver?” The rookie glanced at the grinning man cradling a grenade launcher. “Sir… that’s a very senior leader. Hard to… cite.”\n\n“A leader outranks a general? The PLA is a force of discipline. Even a general gets written up! Now—how senior can that joker behind the launcher be?”\n\n“I don’t know,” the rookie said, “but Comrade Zhang Youxia—the CMC Vice-Chairman—is his driver.”"

  prc_military.305.d: "Since the Northeast Democratic Allied Army days, we’ve built systemic, experience-based combat evaluation. From 1999 onward, Zhurihe—where Genghis Khan once spurred his horse—grew into a vast joint operations lab and assessment range.\n\nThe Taiwan campaign exposed gaps in our force. We are overhauling the evaluation system to meet new training demands.\n\nThe upgraded metrics grade commanders on battlespace sense, planning and decision, C2, combined-arms coordination, improvisation, force economy, method employment; staffs on decision support, planning, coordination, COP control; and formations on plan execution, maneuver, tactics, effects, protection, and sustainment. We integrate adversarial, capability, specialized, and process evaluations into a composite score; refine the multi-dimensional model (AHP + weights + normalization); and expand cross-theater exercises.\n\nWith the new indicators, red-blue force-on-force pays off in real combat power. Only realistic, targeted training reduces losses when the shooting starts.\n\nToday, Zhurihe can run several joint task forces in parallel, render a transparent multi-domain battlespace, monitor and grade land-air joint fights end-to-end, and has spawned hundreds of new tactics from “information leads, systems break.”"

Years ago the 69th Brigade posted a near-700, yet as Red they still fell short on this ancient field.\n\nWith “god’s-eye” information advantages scripted for Blue by the directing staff, many units have had to fight nearly naked—and lost, regrouped, and fought again.\n\nNo, it isn’t “bias”—the aim is to expose gaps. If you only chase a W without the frictions of real war, victory is hollow—and harmful to readiness.\n\nOn paper, winning or losing matters little; in the gut, no one likes surrendering the laurels.\n\nTwo plans now lie before the 69th Brigade commander:"

  prc_military.307.d: "The 69th Brigade’s infiltrators ranged deep—near Blue’s CP—then failed like many before them.\n\nWith directing-staff omniscience, Blue artillery achieved a brutal ~50% effects rate. Under Blue info-ops jamming, 69th’s comms went dark and concealment broke down; their CP was hit.\n\nBlue, alert to infiltrators, hardened defenses; Red’s strike on Blue’s info group fizzled, only pausing it briefly.\n\nJamming, comms severed, and fires—three hammer-blows—collapsed 69th’s command capacity. Recon and info groups were crippled; fires could not answer.\n\nOnce Blue confirmed 69th could not re-form under the C4ISR-fires onslaught, infantry and armor moved to seize the objective."

As jamming ebbed, micro-UAVs finally launched.\n\nThose UAVs pushed sensing-to-strike down to squad and platoon. The 69th chose a different play: use heterogeneous swarms to knit a sustained suppression web, restoring a battered fires system and upending Blue’s plan.\n\nWhile Blue scrambled against pinprick raids and pounding fires, 69th’s staff spotted a seam, struck Blue’s CP, and accomplished the mission card."

Li stared longingly at new recruits jogging outside; he’d rather do laps with a fever than sit through a day of lectures.\n\n“Commander Li, your plan for this scenario?” The instructor’s voice snapped him back.\n\n“I… uh…” He glanced at his tablemate, who grimaced and showed a blank notebook.\n\n“Commander Li can’t answer?” She smiled. “Who can?”\n\nLi expected silence. Instead, nearly half the room raised hands—including a grizzled veteran who’d once been Li’s own CO, twenty-plus years in uniform.\n\nWatching them, a flush of shame rose in Li’s chest."

  prc_military.310.d: "\"Battery—short halt! Guns 1–7, data uploaded. HE frag, three rounds rapid—3, 2, 1—fire!\"\n\nSensors found and fixed; data flowed to the fires cell; artillery struck under EW and air-defense cover. BDA ran; infantry and armor closed to seize the objective.\n\nWatching from the directorate gallery, Vice-Chairman Zhang Youxia stood and said to his staff: “Pass to all echelons: sense, allocate, execute—this is the standard. Our scientists are wiring AI recognition and processing into the loop. Next time, faster still.”\n\nHe knows the weight of superior fires. In 1984 on Songmaoling, Colonel Zhang’s 119th Regiment faced two reinforced enemy regiments. On July 12, supporting fires alone expended roughly 2.09 basic loads of 122-mm howitzer shells and 0.82 of 130-mm rockets; first-echelon and reinforcing troops were scythed down. The stench of corpses hung over the heights for days. Yet with poor information, much steel fell on empty ground; later his gunners were trucking ammunition up from Honghe to maintain the wall of fire. He began to ask: how do we raise effects?\n\nFrom division commander to theater commander, to CMC member and armaments minister, to today’s Vice-Chairman, the answer matured with new tech: only by seizing information supremacy can we truly fuse fires and arms and maximize effects.\n\nFrom tree-like C2 to flattened, from company radio-men to soldier handhelds and battle terminals, from flags and shouts to vehicle-to-vehicle networks, from “Gen-3 core/Gen-2 bulk” to “Gen-3 bulk/Gen-4 core,” the PLA has become an information-age force.\n\nZhang leaned back, satisfied, watching smoke blossom over “enemy” icons: first to see, first to fire—that is survival, and victory."

On the sands stand rows of the newest MBTs, light tanks, SP artillery, trucks and IFVs; before them, ranks of PLA soldiers in the latest exoskeleton suits and \"Stylus\" high-intelligence rifles.\n\nSeveral Mountain Cat ATVs roll up; the people’s generals dismount: CMC Vice-Chairmen Zhang Youxia and He Weidong; CMC members Li Zuocheng and Liu Zhenli; Army Minister Li Qiaoming; and theater commanders Han Weiguo, Huang Ming, and others. Led by Zhang Youxia, they mount the dais and salute the troops.\n\n\"Comrades!\"\n\"Greetings, Comrade Commander!\"\n\nA middle-aged officer—without an exoskeleton—steps forward and reports loudly:\n\n\"Brigadier Man Guangzhi of the 195th Combined Brigade, 81st Group Army, reports to the Central Military Commission with the brigade!\"\n\n\"Good.

  prc_military.312.d: "The PLA Ground Force is proud—and for decades, often \"pent-up.\" The oldest service traces a lineage from Nanchang Uprising troops, the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army, the Eighth Route Army/New Fourth Army, to the PLA itself. From Jinggangshan, Sanwan, Gutian, and the Long March to the Rectification Movement, it was forged by Chairman Mao as the very definition of the people’s army. Yet in lean years we endured—at times even propped up by military commercial ventures—until those were ended under Jiang Zemin. For long afterward we yielded resources to our younger siblings, the Air Force and Navy, and became a punchline among fans.\n\nIn the recent Taiwan operation, Navy and Air Force took the spotlight, while the Army seemed to \"do the chores\"—for shattered foes and antique armor were no match.\n\nToday, with reforms complete, robot dogs and UAVs at the lowest echelons; roaring SP guns and \"knight guns\"; fifth-generation MBTs and IFVs sprinting; ghostlike Mountain Cats everywhere—together form an unstoppable steel torrent. Paired with \"Stylus\" intelligent small arms, exoskeletons across the force, relentless training, and world-class political work and discipline, we have forged the finest soldiers.\n\nThe People’s Army proudly declares: we remain the Republic’s most reliable guardian; since 1949 the undefeated land force; unafraid of any challenger.

Yet the crucible also revealed gaps.\n\nTo meet a more complex future battlefield, we will reorganize the SSF into four pillars—Joint Logistics, Space, Cyberspace, and Information Support—fielding advanced systems to deliver full-spectrum support to the PLA."

As new-era PLA, you must be ready—always.\" Zhang took a bottle of orange drink from a bodyguard.\n\nWatching the spirited scene, he thought of his father General Zhang Zongxun’s tales of the Northwest Field Army’s privations. \"If only our weapons had been better… if only we’d had more grain…\" Those words branded themselves on the son’s heart—through the elder’s passing, the former minister of logistics still couldn’t let go of the Army’s sustainment needs.\n\nZhang looked up into the sky, drew a long breath, and blinked back the rising heat in his eyes."

Not today, though: today his unit would support a team testing a suborbital penetration vehicle, providing data for Joint Staff evaluation.\n\n23:11—the launch. Gao slewed the radar beam to the notified sector. Twenty-six minutes… nothing. By the provided ephemeris the target should already be in line-of-sight. He radioed: “Command, ABM site here—vehicle status normal?”\n\n“ABM site, Command—nominal. Datalink solid.”\n\nThen the return hit. Gao read the solution and swore: “Good grief—suborbital, skimming the air, and it’s maneuvering. What am I supposed to intercept that with—my forehead?” Grumbling done, he soberly computed the current missile’s engagement probability.\n\nAt the next day’s review he logged his assessment: the vehicle could penetrate all existing national BMD architectures—and its maneuver envelope was, in his words, “beyond imagination.”"

  prc_military.503.a: "“Exercise Joint Sword concluded successfully!”"
  prc_military.503.t: "Joint Sword: Large-Scale Tri-Service Exercise"
  prc_military.503.d: "Since the Taiwan campaign, the PLA had not staged a tri-service exercise on this scale. Ranges from Xinjiang to the East China Sea were booked—unprecedented. The directing HQ was not forward, but here in Beijing at the new CMC Joint Ops Command Center.\n\nMilitary media set up carefully controlled cameras to protect secrets. Staffers and commanders waited for the CMC to arrive.\n\nAt 08:00 the doors opened. Chairman Xi and the Commission entered; officers rose and saluted.\n\n“Good morning, Comrade Chairman!”\n\n“Greetings, comrades—thank you for your hard work.” He returned the salute and took the dais.\n\n“Chairman, Exercise Joint Sword is ready for execution. Your orders?” reported General Zhang Youxia, overall director.\n\n“I declare the exercise begun.”\n\nAcross five theaters the drills surged to life; torrents of data flooded the big screen.\n\n“Air Force: large enemy air package detected in the Eastern Theater—our forces are scrambling per plan.”\n\n“Army: hostile incursion on the Western frontier—two heavy combined-arms brigades mobilized.”\n\n“Strategic Support: milsat coverage live to all theaters; Joint Logistics moving sustainment.”\n\n“Navy: enemy fleet aims to choke Malacca—Guangxi–Guangdong dual-carrier groups formed, moving to contact.”\n\nWatching orders flow and blue/red icons dance, the Chairman’s thoughts turned heavy—on other continents great powers had fallen into flame. Such ruin must never visit this land again.\n\nNear midnight, with each theater closing cleanly, he allowed himself a smile. Two Gutian Conferences; two great reforms—the people’s army handed down by the forerunners had been forged into a dragon unafraid of any foe.\n\nTonight, the nation would sleep soundly. The PLA would break any hand raised against China.\nHe slipped a glutinous millet bar from his pocket and took a quiet bite."

  # === GRAND REFORM — “DRAGON SOARS”
  # =========================================================
  prc_military.504.a: "Flames rise—let the dragon ascend!"
  prc_military.504.t: "PLA Reform Complete!"
  prc_military.504.d: "In 1927 a rifle cracked at Nanchang—the people gained their own army. Soviet Red Army, Chinese Red Army, Eighth Route, New Fourth, People’s Liberation Army—the names changed, the essence did not: the red banner, the Party’s command, Party branches down to the company line, and Mao Zedong Thought held high.\n\nA century of wind and rain saw many underestimate this force; all were corrected by steel will. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought created this army; President Jiang ended the era of business-run units; President Xi’s twin reforms finally forged the PLA into the world’s most advanced force—relentless realistic training, iron discipline, political work without peer, deep integration across services, fused data and C2 chains, leading-edge equipment, and combat-proven doctrine. Today the PLA stands far ahead. Armies once dominant—of America, the Soviets, Germany, Britain, France—now pale by comparison.\n\nThe world burns; a spark could set Asia alight. But the people will not fear. From snowbound Northeast to the Tibetan highlands, from the Xinjiang desert to the storming South and East Seas—the people’s army stands watch.\n\nA true dragon does not fear flame—it rises through it."

  # =========================================================
  prc_military.260.a: "Begin research!"
  prc_military.260.t: "The 203 mm Artillery Project"
  prc_military.260.d: "On an ordinary day at the Army Science & Tech Institute, an ‘unexpected guest’ arrived: CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Youxia.\n\n“What—cat got your tongues? Am I that scary?”\n\n“No, sir!”\n\n“Then relax. Sit—brief me on the new gun.”\n\n“Yes, Comrade Vice Chairman. Given global trends, brigade-level organic artillery is no longer adequate. We propose a new system: caliber 203 mm, with tight controls on size and weight to enable a truck chassis; fully automated ammo handling to ease crews; and—per your priority—native integration with our datalinks for precision cueing and rapid support. That concludes the brief—your guidance?”\n\nZhang blinked, muttering just loud enough for his aide: “Well I’ll be… a truck-mounted 203.” After a beat he nodded. “Good. Strong firepower, high automation, full digitization. I decide that the 203 mm system will…”"

  prc_military.267.a: "Fantastic!"
  prc_military.267.t: "Report on the 203 mm Project"
  prc_military.267.d: "Success.\n\nAt a test range a never-before-seen giant sat on its pad. A Lynx all-terrain vehicle rolled up; out stepped Vice Chairman Zhang. He hurried to the gun, running a palm along the barrel. “What a piece… ahem—let’s shoot. I’ll watch here—give me a terminal for BDA.”\n\nThe crew brought the system alive: stabilizers dug in; the autoloader cycled a round; a drone pushed target coordinates; the tube slewed.\n\n“Sir, target laid.”\n\n“Fire.”\n\nThe report punched the air; even through headsets eardrums throbbed. On screen a fireball rose and the target vanished.\n\n“Test successful!” Engineers hugged; Zhang kept rubbing the barrel’s still-warm steel.\n\n“A fine machine—truly fine. Though… perhaps we should upgrade the gunners’ headsets?”"

  prc_military.10044.d: "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t £GFX_MSS_event_texticon   \n\n\n\n\nRespected Chairman,\n\nThrough corroborated agent reports, cyber infiltration, and satellite imagery, we assess that Japan is preparing to commission a large, modern covert fleet. Precise scale remains uncertain. Should these forces join the PDO navy, their strength would markedly increase; however, Joint Staff judges that the PLAN’s current numbers and capability still exceed PDO forces by a wide margin.\n\nIn line with the principle “strategically despise the enemy; tactically value him,” I recommend JSD and Navy HQ track this development closely. MSS and Information Support will provide continuous updates.\n\nRespectfully,"

  prc_military.2761.a: "Capture lessons—strengthen the PLAAF."
  prc_military.2761.t: "Project Luanbird: Partial Success"
  prc_military.2761.d: "After months of effort, the Luanbird air–space carrier fell short of its full ambition: propulsion complexity and high-altitude structures outpaced today’s limits, and primary development was halted. Yet the endeavor yielded gems—subsystems and algorithms with immediate value. These will be spun into upgrades across the active fleet. As one lead put it: “The Luanbird did not soar to the ninth heaven—but from it we tempered a sharper edge.” Debate flickered over sunk cost, but most citizens trust these seeds will make the PLAAF stronger, readier to defend the sky and defeat any foe."
  
  # === QILIN (ALL-ELECTRIC TANK) — KICKOFF ===
  prc_military.2711.a: "A heavy mood"
  prc_military.2711.b: "On second thought…"
  prc_military.2711.t: "All-Electric Tank Symposium"
  prc_military.2711.d: "With integrated-electric systems now in the spotlight, the Navy’s new ships have become proof-of-concept for the technology—naturally turning eyes toward the Army’s crown jewel: the main battle tank.\n\nA symposium on an all-electric tank convened at the CMC Equipment Development Department. Experts from many institutes gathered to debate feasibility.\n\nAcademician Ma Weiming opened: “We have all witnessed the efficiency, stability, and economy of full-electric systems at sea. Bringing that pedigree into tank design would usher in a new era for armored warfare.” The hall fell quiet as everyone weighed the potential.\n\nA young engineer leapt up, waving preliminary blueprints: “Electrification means massive instant torque. Compared to the gradual output of diesel, an all-electric tank would pounce like a leopard—instant acceleration, a breakthrough in mobility.” Heads nodded; anticipation thickened the air.\n\nA gray-haired professor then voiced concerns: “Bus stability, battery energy density, thermal management—these are mountain ranges on this path. Only a robust, efficient, and stable power supply will keep such a tank fighting across harsh battlefields.”\n\nThe words landed like a cool douse of water—sobering the room to the challenges ahead."

  prc_military.2712.a: "Initiate Project Qilin"
  prc_military.2712.t: "Greenlight"
  prc_military.2712.d: "As the mood grew tense, the doors swung open. In strode CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Youxia—ramrod straight, stars glinting on his shoulders. His steps were steady; his smile, warm; his eyes, full of respect for the gathered experts.\n\n“Welcome, Comrade General!” Startled, the room rose as one, joy flashing in their faces.\n\nZhang waved them down. “Comrades, I came to see you. Your research is priceless to our defense and science. Don’t carry the burden alone—tell this old soldier your difficulties. The State takes your work very seriously.”\n\nRelief spread. An elder expert ventured, “Vice Chairman, we still need your decision.”\n\nZhang chuckled. “Me, decide? You’ll say I’m a ‘big-gun’ again. But I’m loud because I want combat power. Budgets are healthy—of course tank research moves up.” Laughter rolled; then his face turned firm. “We can’t cling to the past. Tech races forward; Japan and Russia are modernizing hard. Our kit and training must keep pace. The all-electric tank should be pursued—but in small, fast steps. Build an experimental platform first and see it in the real world. Agreed?”\n\nNods all around. Zhang approved the experimental platform—codename: Qilin."

  prc_military.2721.a: "Forward to Vice Chairman Zhang Youxia"
  prc_military.2721.t: "Report on the All-Electric Tank ‘Qilin’"
  prc_military.2721.d: "The Equipment Development Department has completed Qilin’s prototype. It meets design indices—but exposes notable flaws.\n\nQilin’s electric drive offers clear gains in energy efficiency and reduced reliance on fuel; it can approach quietly in combat. Two core subprojects—an electromagnetic main gun and electric propulsion—passed rigorous reliability trials.\n\nBut the new power architecture brings stability risks. Initial tests saw intermittent power-module dropouts—battlefield-fatal events that would leave the tank dead in place.\n\nThe EM gun’s hit rate was far below expectations; the ballistic calibration system appears to fight the power architecture under combined loads.\n\nMoreover, the powertrain’s EMI caused repeated comms dropouts.\n\nWhile the e-power pack greatly simplifies mechanics, it demands entirely new maintenance skills—posing a major training and personnel challenge.\n\nRecommendation: move Qilin into technology reserve status and share the key datasets across PLA research entities."

  prc_military.2722.a: "Project Qilin: Partial Success"
  prc_military.2722.t: "Decision on Project Qilin"
  prc_military.2722.d: "To the Equipment Development Department:\n\nYour recommendation to transition Qilin to the tech reserve is approved. Practice shows current materials and comms tech cannot yet support a fully combat-ready all-electric MBT. Subprojects already matured—especially the EM gun and electric propulsion—should proceed toward integration with existing platforms. Coordinate urgently with industry so Qilin’s成果 can be converted into combat power without delay."

  prc_military.2731.d: "Naval Research Academy — Ma Weiming\n\nTo the Central Military Commission:\n\nShort-range electromagnetic acceleration has reached maturity. This breakthrough opens unprecedented opportunities and will drive sweeping change.\n\nMilitarily, it enables new weapon systems. For a vertical-launch system using EM boost, missiles leave the cell with far higher initial energy—greatly extending range.\n\nAnother key benefit: drastically reduced launcher wear. EM boost is more efficient and stable than legacy mechanisms, cutting friction and energy loss.\n\nOur trials show that with EM boost, most high-G airframes can achieve hypersonic flight.\n\nWith integrated electric propulsion now standard across our fleet, an EM-boost upgrade module can be fitted widely, massively enhancing combat power."

  prc_military.2741.a: "Prepare for shipboard trials"

  prc_military.2742.t: "Project Tianshu Succeeds"
  prc_military.2742.d: "A fine drizzle stitched the gray sea; damp air clung to the deck. Two officers in white strode beneath a tilted umbrella.\n\n“Comrade Dong Jun, let’s board,” said Academician Ma Weiming. They stepped onto Jiqui Guang as the ensign cracked in the wind.\n\nMa’s calm voice filled the ship: “Shipwide—prepare for EM-boost VLS trial.”\n\nFingers danced over consoles; checks rippled station to station.\n\n“Three, two, one—launch.” The word fell—and the round leapt like an arrow loosed from a taut string, screaming skyward.\n\n“Report: data nominal. The project is a success.”\n\nCheers rolled bow to stern. Months of toil had found their answer, while the flag at the prow snapped in the gale, proclaiming the moment."

  prc_military.3611.d: "Morning mist still veiled Chengdu’s outskirts when Old Zhang split a hot roll at the street stall. His oil-stained phone blared a short video: “...our indigenously developed sixth-generation stealth fighter completed its first flight on the 26th!” His spoon clanged into the soy milk; splashes freckled a student’s canvas bag, unnoticed. On-screen, beneath a steel-blue sky, a tailless flying-wing howled past with a J-20S in chase, exhaust plumes sketching a jade ribbon in the dawn.\n\nIn the Mianyang wind tunnel, Engineer Liang removed his goggles, remembering pounding the dorm wall in 1999 when the embassy was bombed, clutching Aviation Knowledge in his fists; remembering the J-20’s 2011 debut and the U.S. defense secretary’s sour face—cheers caught in throats that day. Now, beyond the glass, ’90s-born engineers coolly watched three vectoring engines stream realtime data—as if tinkering with toy cars. To them, “far ahead” already felt normal.\n\nBy the Jinjiang, a teahouse owner pivoted a 4K projector toward the street. Couriers, retirees, students all paused to look up. The display showed lead ship “36011” cutting the blue; its skin’s stealth sheen flashed a cold jade, like a chilong rising from Kunlun myth.\n\nDefense banter flooded the livestream: “No vertical tails—how do you track that?” “Three engines? Twice an F-35’s payload easy!” “See that hex port? Bet it’s a DEW aperture!”\n\nIn the square the Great Man stood, greeting the people with an eternal wave—just as on the day a nation was declared."

Below, ridges rolled like a stony sea.\n\n“Unknown contact—radar resolves as friendly.” A shadow crossed the canopy.\n\n“Is that… a J-8?” An aging silhouette clawed far past its limits, sheltering the newborn fighter. On the wing, the numbers 81192 flickered through the haze.\n\n“Request tower confirm airspace radar status.” The pilot stayed calm, throttling forward. The ginkgo leaf leapt faster still. He and his WSO traded a glance—words unnecessary. This would be kept between them; no report could capture it.\n\n“Tower confirms: airspace clear. Yulong-01, you are at max speed—collect data.”\n\n“Yulong-01 copy.” The old warrior dwindled into cloud, gone without a trace.\n\nThe jade leaf sketched a lazy arc in the sky—and turned for home."
