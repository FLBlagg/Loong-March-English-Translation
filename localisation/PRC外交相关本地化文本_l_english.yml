  PRC_new_EA_order: "Establish a New East Asian Order"
  PRC_new_EA_order_desc: "With the United States in civil war, Europe and Russia aflame again, and China reunified, the world has been upended. In this once-in-a-century upheaval—faced with provocations by the Japan-led Asian neoliberal bloc—it is time to found a new order in East Asia and proclaim China’s rise."

  PRC_secure_south_eastern_asia: "Ensure Indochina Cooperation"
  PRC_secure_south_eastern_asia_desc: "From antiquity to today, Indochina has been within China’s sphere of influence. After the collapse of the British–French colonial order, despite grievances, China built economic ties with these states. Now we should deepen cooperation and investment."

  PRC_rescure_ASEAN: "Aid ASEAN"
  PRC_rescure_ASEAN_desc: "In the 19th and 20th centuries, China—like many Southeast Asian nations—suffered Western imperialist invasion and colonization, and fought for freedom and independence. In the 21st century, our economic and cultural ties have only grown. With ASEAN’s dissolution, China must invest in and assist them, bringing them into our alliance system."

  PRC_aid_pakistan: "Support Pakistan"
  PRC_aid_pakistan_desc: "Pakistan is our traditional ally and a crucial partner to pin down India along the frontier. We will hold joint exercises and provide advanced equipment—main battle tanks, 4th-gen fighters, and more—so the Pakistani Army becomes a persistent headache for India."

  PRC_Chosen_Reform: "Advance Reform in Korea"
  PRC_Chosen_Reform_desc: "The DPRK has long been one of China’s key allies. Yet after the USSR collapsed, sanctions and authoritarian rule inflicted great hardship on its people. It is time to push comprehensive reform and opening—not only to prepare for reunification, but to build a prosperous, free, and democratic new Korea."

  PRC_Unsucceed_Thing: "Continue the Unfinished Task"
  PRC_Unsucceed_Thing_desc: "The Yalta arrangements left the Korean nation divided for 70 years. This must end. We will prepare the DPRK for renewed war—industrially, socially, and militarily."

  PRC_Regain_Mongolia: "Cast Our Gaze North"
  PRC_Regain_Mongolia_desc: "Outer Mongolia’s return has greatly boosted public confidence. Calls to recover Outer Manchuria and Tannu Tuva are rising among the masses and some cadres. With [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] bogged down in Europe and its Asian forces enfeebled, a full plan to reclaim our historic lands now lies before the Politburo Standing Committee."

  PRC_Stablize_Backyard: "Restore Outer Manchuria"
  PRC_Stablize_Backyard_desc: "A century ago, a weak Qing court let the Russian Empire illegally seize our Outer Northeast and massacre our people. For 170 years, the region drifted. Now the lost child returns to its mother. What a semi-colonial China ceded to imperialists, a great people’s China will take back! It is time to reintegrate what has always been our rightful land.\n\n§RComrades, welcome home!§!"

  PRC_Chinese_Begonia: "Establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region"
  PRC_Chinese_Begonia_desc: "After nearly two years of preparation, construction, and mass work, we have completed post-collapse stabilization and politico-economic integration in Outer Mongolia. The new regional Party secretary is selected; sandbreak belts ring the Gobi; separatists are suppressed; livelihoods are improved; the transition committee’s tasks are done. It is time to found the Mongolian Regional Party Committee and the People’s Government of the Autonomous Region."

  PRC_Lockdown_PDO: "Sanction the Tai Pact"
  PRC_Lockdown_PDO_desc: "During Taiwan’s liberation, the Japan-led Pacific Defense Pact shamelessly intervened, raising PLA casualties. We cannot ignore this. It is time to punish them with trade sanctions."

  PRC_Secret_Sabotage: "Covert Action Against the Tai Pact"
  PRC_Secret_Sabotage_desc: "The Tai Pact persists in targeting China and stoking a new East Asian Cold War—overreaching like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Tactically, we must respect the enemy. We will intensify intelligence penetration—sending agents, assets, and hackers into key organs and harvesting critical data online."

  PRC_eadi_command_system: "ASEAN Integrated Command System"
  PRC_eadi_command_system_desc: "To prepare for possible total war with the Tai Pact, we will unify the ASEAN command chain and further train and discipline allied forces."

  PRC_finilize_korean_revolution: "Complete the Korean Revolution"
  PRC_finilize_korean_revolution_desc: "After long effort, the DPRK is our most loyal ally. The CCP can now deeply engage the WPK’s internal affairs, and the PLA has integrated the KPA into its operational system. This will aid our guidance of DPRK domestic policy and preparations for struggle against the southern foe."

  PRC_block_pdo: "Total Blockade of the Tai Pact"
  PRC_block_pdo_desc: "As the DPRK pursues reunification, the Tai Pact still gambles on intervening—risking a Greater East Asia War. China will not permit it. The People’s Navy, with ASEAN partners, will immediately impose a comprehensive economic and trade blockade on Tai Pact members."

  PRC_chinas_greatest_hour1: "China’s Greatest Hour"
  PRC_chinas_greatest_hour1_desc: "Mountain winds surge and waves race; from afar, the monkeys’ babble.\n\nSelf-styled recluses—who heeds them? §3Stench spreads on every side.§!\n\nAn §Gelephant§! wails beside them; behind, the §LEagle§! screeches.\n\nSun-shot sands, smoke settles; a cudgel makes slick rogues beg.\n\nNo shame in baseness—ever chasing trifles—§Rthey deserve a hard blow.§!\n\nDrumbeats roll like dragons; phoenix cries answer the call."

  PRC_Formulating_war_policies1: "Formulate War Policy"
  PRC_Formulating_war_policies1_desc: "The ASEAN Joint Operations Command has pre-planned for total war and drafted multiple operations. It is time to strike the Tai Pact. People’s Liberation Army—forward!"

  PRC_operation_majestic1: "§YLeap Across to Japan§!"
  PRC_operation_majestic1_desc: "The People’s Navy has absolute command of the sea. Under naval and air cover our armies will land in Japan with irresistible force—§Yto avenge Nanjing§!."

  PRC_kashmir_road1: "§YPincer India§!"
  PRC_kashmir_road1_desc: "India has equipment and manpower, but ASEAN has long encircled it strategically. We will attack from four directions at once—letting India taste what ‘encircled on all sides’ truly means."

  PRC_operation_coronet1: "§YLiberate Australia§!"
  PRC_operation_coronet1_desc: "Australia and New Zealand were Five Eyes members. With the U.S. dissolved, that alliance is a husk. Time to put out those two eyes."

  PRC_coastal_defense_brigades1: "Coastal Defense"
  PRC_coastal_defense_brigades1_desc: "With larger mobilizable forces and more equipment, we will strengthen key coastal lines and maritime strongpoints. Not a single enemy warship will enter Chinese waters."

  PRC_embrace_the_future1: "Embrace the Future"
  PRC_embrace_the_future1_desc: "Armies that master cutting-edge technology and employ it without hesitation win wars—an eternal truth. We will field recent military-science成果 in combat; these newly unveiled weapons will severely deter our foes."

  PRC_all_chinese_mobilization1: "All-China §RGeneral Mobilization§!"
  PRC_all_chinese_mobilization1_desc: "We must admit the war’s severity exceeds expectations. We cannot rely on current forces alone. We will launch a new §Rgeneral mobilization§!, building the largest army in our history in the shortest time."

  PRC_pla_resdy_for_war: "PLA Maximum Readiness"
  PRC_pla_resdy_for_war_desc: "Calm vanishes; rain lashes and winds howl. The reactionaries of the old Asia-Pacific join hands, mantis-like, to block history’s tide. The PLA’s steel torrent is ready to smash all vermin resistance!\n\n§OAnts on a locust tree boast of great states; fleas shaking a trunk—how could it be easy?§!\n\n§RThe west wind drops leaves on Chang’an—arrows whistle in flight.§!"

  gaw.272117.t: "Great Asia War Mode Selection"
  gaw.272117.d: "In version 1.928 “Red Banners in the Wind,” we reworked Great Asia–related operations and companion events. Without higher difficulties enabled, players may win the Great Asia War too quickly and miss this content. We therefore added a special mode that gives Tai Pact territory a tile debuff, “Offensives Not Yet Undertaken,” to slow player advances.\n\nIf you want to experience the new focuses and events, enable this special mode to slow the war’s tempo; if you want to win the Great Asia War quickly, do not enable it."

  gaw.1.d: "\nCompatriots across China:\n\nToday, ignoring our repeated warnings, Japanese forces brazenly launched a surprise attack on our stabilization units stationed in Korea. Our officers and soldiers responded swiftly and fought back heroically; firefights continue.\n\nOur intelligence assesses that this provocation on the Korean Peninsula is a prelude to a large-scale war of aggression. In the East China Sea direction, Tai Pact forces point their spear at our coast; in the southwest, the India-led Tai Pact is steadily increasing pressure along our border. These dangerous developments show that the so-called “new understanding” and “new policy” toward China, released by Japanese militarism and the anti-China Tai Pact under its leadership, were merely smokescreens for yet another war of aggression against the peace-loving peoples of Asia. The Communist Party of China long ago pointed this out to our compatriots and to the peoples of Asia; now the smoke has cleared. Japanese militarism and its Tai Pact lackeys’ ambition to subvert our government and endanger our territorial integrity and our people’s lives stands exposed before every Chinese citizen.\n\nCompatriots! Korea is in peril! The Northeast is in peril! The Chinese nation is in peril!\n\nComrades and compatriots! The most dangerous hour for our nation has come again. All our efforts with our ASEAN allies to resolve matters peacefully have been met only with relentless Tai Pact pressure. The die is cast; the entire nation must abandon any hope or expectation of a shameful peace with the Tai Pact. Only with one heart—Party, army, and people united—only by liberating Japan and liberating Asia, do we find our path forward!\n\nCompatriots across China! We should praise the heroic resistance of our stabilization forces in Korea! We should firmly support the PLA’s proclamation to liberate all the peoples of Asia! Our valiant People’s Liberation Army has begun deploying troops to every front, ready at any time to deal the Tai Pact imperialists a crushing blow.\n\nThe CPC Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, the State Council, together with the National People’s Congress and the CPPCC, demand the immediate mobilization of all armed forces, the prompt eradication of traitors and all Tai Pact spies within our borders, and the consolidation of the rear.\n\nWe call upon the whole nation to give its all to the sacred War of Asia’s Liberation!\n\nOur slogans are:\n\nArm to defend peace—defend Korea—defend China!\n\nUtterly destroy Japanese militarism and the anti-China Tai Pact alliance!\n\nCompatriots of China—unite! Build a Great Wall of patriotic unity; forge a sharp spear for Asia’s liberation; strive unremittingly for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the great liberation of Asia!\n\nDown with the reactionary Tai Pact! Build a free and better New Asia!\n\n\nCPC Central Committee, Central Military Commission, State Council,\nNational People’s Congress, Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference\nIssued this day"

  gaw.2: "Enough Is Enough"
  gaw.2.t: "The Patience of the Chinese People Has Limits"
  gaw.2.d: "\nXinhua—Recently, the Japan-led anti-China Tai Pact has repeatedly smeared China under the pretext of “human rights,” slandering our international image, spouting reckless rhetoric, and acting with gross irresponsibility to stoke regional tensions. The impudence of the Tai Pact’s anti-China authorities has reached an intolerable level.\n\nChina has always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, committed to building friendly and cooperative relations with all countries. We have always believed that differences and disputes between nations should be resolved through dialogue and consultation, not through confrontation and vilification. However, during the Taiwan Strait campaign of the Liberation War, Tai Pact countries repeatedly provided arms and even dispatched mercenaries to the Taiwan region of China, obstructing national reunification, in grave violation of the one-China principle and the joint communiqués establishing diplomatic relations with China and with Japan and the ROK. These actions seriously infringed China’s sovereignty and security interests and sent a dangerously wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” separatists. China expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition, and lodged stern representations at once. Yet, for their own reactionary interests, Tai Pact authorities have continued frenzied anti-China actions, deceiving their own people at home and hitching their innocent citizens to the chariot of war abroad, organizing and planning arson along our borders, interfering with Chinese fishermen, even kidnapping Chinese personnel and massacring our people—causing thousands of deaths and economic losses in the hundreds of millions of RMB.\n\nIgnoring China’s protests and their own peoples’ calls for peace, the Tai Pact authorities continue to intensify war preparations—rushing conscription, expanding the military, and frequently conducting exercises aimed at China, while staging so-called “purification” operations and deploying more troops along our borders. Recently, the Japan-led Tai Pact “General Headquarters” has launched a nationwide “total mobilization” movement across its members, openly declaring China the “new target,” calling to “fight a massive war,” to “fight a war to wash away past shame”—their arrogance could hardly be greater.\n\nWe hereby solemnly state:\n\n1) We will resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any act that infringes upon our sovereignty or harms our interests will be met with all necessary countermeasures.\n\n2) We urge Japan to strictly abide by Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation, immediately cease all militarist propaganda, and conduct a genuine, effective, and orderly nationwide demilitarization under international supervision. The spirit of Article 6 must and shall be implemented in full.\n\n3) We urge all members of the anti-China Tai Pact to seriously reflect on their disgraceful behavior as accomplices of Japanese militarism, recall its wartime crimes in World War II, and immediately stop all actions that damage China’s interests and undermine regional peace and stability.\n\n4) We call on relevant countries to return to the correct track of dialogue and cooperation, and, on the basis of mutual respect and equality and mutual benefit, jointly safeguard the stability and development of international relations.\n\n5) We stress that unilateralism and power politics win no hearts; any attempt to contain China’s development is doomed to fail.\n\n6) We again remind the anti-China Tai Pact not to underestimate the Chinese people’s firm will and great capacity to defend national interests. Those who play with fire will burn themselves; any challenge to China’s bottom line will bear the corresponding consequences.\n\nJapanese militarism and its Tai Pact lackeys have gone far enough on the anti-China road. The patience and restraint of the Chinese people have limits. China bullies no one, and will never allow others to bully us. If people do not offend us, we will not offend them; if people offend us, we will offend them. We mean what we say. We sternly warn the Tai Pact authorities: if you forget the catastrophic failure of your armed interference in the Taiwan Strait campaign, and, gaining an inch, continue your reckless ways, you will receive the punishment you deserve.\n\nLet us put it plainly in advance:"
  gaw.2.a: "§RDo not say we were not forewarned.§!"

  gaw.3: "Chairman’s Address to the Whole Army"
  gaw.3.t: "Chairman’s Address to the Whole Army"
  gaw.3.d: "\nAll officers and soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army, service members of the People’s Armed Police, civilian personnel in the forces, and militia and reserves:\n\nThe Communist Party of China and the people’s army under the Party’s leadership are revolutionary forces. Our army exists solely to liberate the people and serves, completely and thoroughly, the interests of the people of our nation and of the world. The Taiwan Strait campaign is a classic example of our struggle to liberate the Chinese people; like the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, it will be remembered forever as a glorious deed of the people’s army.\n\nWe repeatedly warned the Tai Pact states, hoping they would approach relations with China calmly and cease interfering in our internal affairs. They refused to listen, never shedding their larcenous intent, insisting on fighting our great people’s army and obstructing China’s unification. Thus, in the Taiwan Strait campaign, they were defeated by our well-prepared, resolute people’s army.\n\nNow the Tai Pact continues to clamor about stopping the Korean people from pursuing reunification, even at the cost of launching an all-out war. Korea is our traditional ally and partner. Seventy years ago, the so-called “UN forces” led by the United States shamelessly intervened in Korea’s war of reunification. To protect peace and defend our motherland, our heroic Chinese People’s Volunteers crossed the Yalu River and, shoulder to shoulder with the Koreans, drove back the UN forces. Yet due to the obstruction of U.S. imperialism and its client states, the course of Korean reunification was forced to a halt, and the Korean people endured division for over seventy years.\n\nThat situation changes today. The Tai Pact’s intervention and bluster will not shake our resolve to assist Korea in completing the great cause of reunification. If Tai Pact countries willfully ignore our warnings and wage war on Korea, our heroic People’s Liberation Army will, together with the peace-loving peoples of Asia, overthrow the reactionary Tai Pact regimes headed by Japanese militarism and fight for the liberation of the peoples of the world!"

  gaw.100: "China Announces Sanctions on the Tai Pact"
  gaw.100.t: "China Announces Sanctions on the Tai Pact"
  gaw.100.d: "\nForeign Minister Wang Yi recently announced: During the Taiwan Strait campaign, the Japan-led Pacific Defense Treaty Organization, in spite of China’s stern protests and repeated representations, openly provided political shelter to the Taiwan puppet regime, funded its armed reactionary actions, and brazenly concocted the fallacy of “one China, one Taiwan,” violating the international consensus on the Taiwan question, damaging China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and rudely interfering in China’s internal affairs—placing itself in opposition to the Chinese people. In view of this, China will implement the following sanctions:\n\n1) Restrict exports of high-tech products to Tai Pact countries, including but not limited to new-energy vehicles, smartphones, photovoltaic panels, industrial robots, and more than a dozen other items;\n\n2) Reduce economic investment in Tai Pact countries and withdraw Chinese-funded enterprises operating there;\n\n3) Cut imports of raw materials from Tai Pact countries, such as Japanese timber and Australian iron ore;\n\n…\n\nHistory has proven that there is only one China in the world, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing all China. Out of goodwill to uphold Asia-Pacific international relations, the Chinese government has repeatedly warned Japan to recognize the trend of the times. Regrettably, Japan has ignored China’s solemn warnings, flouted basic norms of international relations, and fanned the flames of domestic militarism. To safeguard our legitimate rights and interests, China has no choice but to impose sanctions. All members of the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization must bear all consequences arising therefrom. We urge those countries to immediately correct their mistakes, and not to underestimate the firm confidence, steadfast will, and powerful capability of the Chinese people to defend national unity and territorial integrity."

  gaw.101: "Report on the ‘Anti-Tai Pact Covert Operations’"
  gaw.101.t: "Report on the Ministry of State Security’s §b“§!Anti-Tai Pact Covert Operations§b”§!"
  gaw.101.d: "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  £GFX_MSS_event_texticon   \n\n\n\n\nRespected Chairman:\n\nSince the launch of the “Anti-Tai Pact Covert Operations,” our actions on enemy soil have achieved major successes. We submit the following report for your review.\n\n(1) Japan: Since last month, our defense attachés at the embassy in Tokyo have discreetly met, via diplomatic channels, with numerous key figures within the Japanese government who hold pessimistic views toward war. These individuals occupy important or critical posts across many departments in Japan’s military and political spheres. After contact with our attachés, they expressed willingness to support all our current activities in Japan and goodwill toward our postwar efforts to reconstruct Japan’s government. We will provide them with material and financial assistance within our capacity and direct them to lobby internally so as to expand the influence of the pessimistic faction within the Japanese government.\n\n(2) Australia: Our infiltration of the Australian government is ongoing. However, due to currents such as white-supremacist ideology, anti-war forces struggle to gain strong positions. Through espionage we have actively reached out to many Chinese families living in Australia, combining financial support with appeals to national righteousness; this has produced major results. Our liaison points in Australia have increased steadily, and we can now broadly grasp production and daily-life intelligence across military and civilian sectors.\n\n(3) India: Owing to historical legacies, New Delhi’s control over the localities is exceedingly weak, and our diaspora lacks sufficient capacity to develop intelligence. We therefore cultivate local elites, prioritizing conciliation supplemented by economics, and have gained influence among princely and regional powers. Meanwhile, by supporting strains of Sikh revanchism, inter-ethnic suspicion and division within the Indian military are growing by the day—favorable to our operations.\n\n(4) Furthermore, our ongoing “Storm” cyber-attack station operations have achieved great success. By sending Trojan emails and executing DDoS attacks against government departments in Japan, Australia, and India, we have crippled many Tai Pact institutions and stolen large quantities of intelligence and secret codes, intercepting voluminous enemy communications across sea, land, and air. Internal red-teaming has further strengthened our defenses and countermeasures against enemy EW and hacking, and we have successfully repelled multiple large-scale attacks.\n\nIn sum, the “Anti-Tai Pact Covert Operations” have yielded major results. We recommend pressing the advantage and expanding gains. We await the Chairman’s instructions on concrete plans."

  gaw.102: "Solemn Warning"
  gaw.102.t: "PLAN Announces: If the Tai Pact Intervenes in Korea, a Naval Blockade Will Follow"
  gaw.102.d: "\nXinhua—Admiral Dong Jun, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, held a press conference in Beijing.\n\nA foreign reporter asked: “We know China recently declared support for Korea in its war of reunification. The Tai Pact issued a hardline statement and threatened to intervene. ASEAN–Tai Pact relations have already hit rock bottom, with repeated frictions. If the Tai Pact intervenes, could the war expand into a full conflict between ASEAN and the Tai Pact? What measures will China take?”\n\nAdmiral Dong replied:\n\n“I must emphasize that the Tai Pact has long flouted international justice—directly supplying weapons to China’s Taiwan region and even dispatching mercenaries to fight there. This is a grave interference in our internal affairs and a serious violation of the one-China principle and the basic norms set forth in the communiqués establishing diplomatic relations between Tai Pact countries and China. In full view of the international community, they have openly provoked China, gravely harming our relations and sharply heightening tensions in the Western Pacific. Now the Tai Pact seeks to further escalate and pour oil on the fire—something we absolutely cannot tolerate. The People’s Navy always heeds the Party’s command, maintains fine style, and can fight and win. Should the Tai Pact intervene, the PLAN, under CMC orders, will resolutely counter—defending our maritime frontiers while taking the offensive to seize sea control and strategic initiative. Drawing on the powerful forces proven in the recovery of Taiwan, we will impose a comprehensive blockade on Tai Pact states, hastening the collapse of their reactionary military bloc.\n\nWe advise the Tai Pact to cease at once all anti-China campaigns, including open slander, intimidation, and the deliberate fomenting of anti-China sentiment; to stop supporting, recognizing, and aiding the so-called ‘Taiwan government-in-exile’; and to hand over all fugitives it openly harbors so they may face the judgment of the Chinese people. The Tai Pact—Japan in particular—must profoundly and comprehensively reflect on the countless crimes committed since the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, adopt a correct attitude, and repent before the peoples of Asia to seek forgiveness.\n\nTurn back before the cliff; mend the pen before all is lost. We again call on the Tai Pact to learn from history, abandon anti-China and anti-peace positions, and work actively for regional peace and stability. The Chinese nation will never permit the Tai Pact to smear and insult our motherland with impunity, and the 1.4 billion Chinese people will defend territorial integrity and national interests at any cost.”"

  gaw.103.d: "Two divided states, one divided nation—the DPRK and the ROK have maintained a delicate balance since the Cold War. To outside observers, after the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the peninsula seemed relatively stable.\n\nRecently, however, mounting global tensions have eroded that stability. Geopolitical frictions and inter-Korean animosities have made the peninsula a powder keg,\n\nand the U.S. civil war and Tai Pact machinations are the twin sparks that ignited it.\n\nKorean reunification has long been the Korean people’s cherished wish. Based on prior assessments, the Tai Pact is highly likely to intervene in a peninsula conflict; war is imminent.\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army must hasten all preparations, make clear and correct decisions, closely monitor Tai Pact movements, and, when necessary, intervene to resolutely safeguard the people’s lives and property and uphold national territorial sovereignty and peace and stability on the peninsula."

EADI countries understand and sympathize deeply with the long-enslaved Ryukyuan and Ainu peoples and decide, at an appropriate time, to enable their national self-determination and autonomy.\n\nOn this basis, EADI countries will prosecute this momentous and protracted war with firm resolve."

  gaw.201: "One Night in Beijing"

  gaw.201.d: "Late night, western outskirts of Beijing.\n\nIn a vast underground tunnel wide enough for two tanks abreast, several black sedans glide to a halt before a massive, all-steel, sealed blast door. Built in the 1960s and repeatedly upgraded over the last two decades, this sprawling subterranean complex received the Central Military Commission and its key organs in orderly fashion on the very day the peninsula crisis erupted—signaling that, after years, China’s armed forces had once again entered a fully mobilized, pre-war posture.\n\nXi Jinping—wearing an army-green Zhongshan suit—strides forward. Led by Major General Yi Qingran of the Central Guard Bureau, he passes swiftly through a series of tightly guarded corridors. At the end, two fully armed young soldiers with resolute faces pull open a solid wooden door, revealing the broad, brightly lit CMC Joint Operations Command.\n\nThe hall gleams with stars: the four services, the five theater commands, and heads of the CMC’s space, cyber, information support, joint logistics, and other departments take their seats, interspersed with ASEAN staff and liaison officers. At center, a giant screen displays the strategic picture—from the Gulf of Aden in the west to Samoa in the east. Across a dynamic map spanning sixteen thousand kilometers, countless points of light mark PLA and ASEAN units.\n\nTemples touched with gray, Xi moves to the central seat. Every service member in the hall rises in unison and snaps to attention, saluting the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. General Zhang Youxia, CMC Vice Chairman and ASEAN Supreme Commander, strides forward: “Reporting to the Chairman! The CMC Joint Operations Command is conducting full-force mobilization, scheduling, and deployment. Please give instructions!”\n\nMeeting hundreds of fervent, earnest gazes, Xi waves calmly and replies evenly: “Proceed according to the plan.”"

  gaw.202.d: "As the principals take their seats, the joint ops hall returns to its busy but orderly rhythm. In a small conference room behind the rostrum, Xi and several senior commanders led by Zhang Youxia are speaking in low voices.\n\n“I’ve read the latest overall plan the Joint Staff revised and submitted. Let’s hear your assessments.”\n\n“Strategically, we’re clearly in the stronger position,” Zhang says confidently, pointing at a large-scale map of Asia on the screen. “For the Tai Pact, the eastern and western fronts are completely split—they’re fighting separate wars. We, by contrast, enjoy huge advantages in sea and rail transport and in interior lines. Whether we go east then west, west then east, or both at once—we seize the initiative.”\n\nXi nods for him to continue; Chief of the Joint Staff Li Zuocheng speaks next: “The western situation is basically nothing to worry about. The last Indo–Pak war made India empty out its cupboard; over the past two years their defense industry has withered, and they can’t replenish materiel or equipment. Many tactical/organizational problems exposed can’t be fixed in time. Meanwhile Pakistan holds the heights and favorable ground; they could be at New Delhi’s outskirts in a week. The Western Theater Air Force can sortie from several Tibetan airfields to seize air superiority over northern India, and our fleets, homeported in Sri Lanka, have already sealed India’s sea lanes.”\n\nWestern Theater commander Wang Xiubin, responsible for the India fight, adds: “Per plan, Pakistan’s units probe first to find weak points, then we punch through quickly. Morale is high—petitions for battle signed in blood and pledges pile up. Also, some young officers from the old 15th Army cooked up a wild scheme with the Marines. If it works, the Indians will be in real trouble—surrounded on all sides.”\n\n“I know the plan,” Xi replies. “It can run in parallel with the existing scheme; tighten the details.”"

The Japs, afraid of repeating their Taiwan debacle, dare not massively reinforce the peninsula; the ROK must split forces to guard against our landings along the coast, and they’re slowly running out of steam. A fresh frontline report assesses the ROK military is planning to give up Seoul and fall back to reorganize a line along Cheongju–Sejong–Asan.”\n\nXi leans in, studies the marked locations, and says slowly: “Mm. That was within the CMC’s prior estimates.”\n\nZhang nods. “Comrade Huang Ming has arrived in Dandong. We just exchanged views by phone. We still think we should proceed as planned. Northern Theater units needn’t enter the DPRK early—no sense scaring the ROK into huddling up and forcing us to gnaw on a tighter pocket. Let the KPA continue to unfold on the flanks and stretch the line. With the ROK’s limited manpower, a defense everywhere is a leak everywhere.

Be fully prepared for their stubbornness and cruelty—Japan in particular.”\n\nZhang: “We’ve prepped multiple follow-on plans after the peninsula campaign, but in any case we must be mentally ready for high-intensity operations on Japanese home soil.”\n\nXi: “Any concrete difficulties?”\n\nZhang thinks a moment: “Mainly tactical. Xiangyang took a team downrange to prep large-scale amphibious ops; Admiral Dong is still at sea. Ding, you go first.”\n\nAir Force Commander General Chang Dingqiu rises: “We’ve observed many JMSDF/ASDF aircraft dispersing to civil airports—messy to handle. They’ve also built many field strips with hardened shelters around Sendai and Aomori; terrain choice is tricky, and the Rocket Force judges direct destruction efficiency as mediocre. We devised a targeted plan: use electronic deception to lure them aloft, then sever their return—bag them all. We expect to seize full air superiority over the archipelago within twelve hours of H-hour and cut JASDF sortie efficiency by more than ninety-five percent—clearing the way for the next phase.”\n\nZhang sips tea and continues: “Also, three days ago the Japanese fleet sailed en masse; the ANZAC fleets raised anchor twelve hours ago. They won’t dare the Java or Sulu Seas. That leaves up past the Solomons, through the Marianas, to rendezvous deep in the western Pacific. Second Department reports an eye-glazing complex plan—pouncing to bite us hard when we launch our landings. Admirals Dong and Wang Hai propose to break finesse with force—no fancy tricks—catch them here and fight a decisive battle.”\n\nPointing decisively, Zhang taps a small spot on the edge of the Northern Marianas.\n\nGeneral He Weidong picks up: “In past years, to counter the Americans here, we quietly laid in plenty. The Yankees didn’t show—fine—we’ll use it on the Japs and Aussies: break their backbone in one battle! Once their navies are sunk, Comrades Han Weiguo and Wu Yanan can start the landings in Australia and New Zealand.”\n\nXi pats Zhang—three years his senior—on the shoulder, then looks to the gray-haired Li Zuocheng: “You’ve all pushed for days—go grab some rest.”\n\nThe two generals—heroes of the counter-attack against Vietnam—smile: “When this war is won, there may be no wars for a long while. We’ll have time to rest then.”"

Dozens of tank commanders hold their breath, awaiting the regimental command’s order.\n\nWanping’s gunshots, Nanjing’s blood, bones whitening the black earth, bombs over Chongqing—thirty million never returned; ninety years of hatred and tears. Militarist beasts lit war again—only to set themselves ablaze: Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kyoto—once-prosperous cities dragooned by hundreds of thousands of frenzied Japanese troops and officers to resist China and her army’s judgment. Now it is Tokyo’s turn—Ginza’s turn, “the most expensive land in Asia.”\n\nAll know Tokyo cannot be held. Overpasses and highways become the best barricades. Suburban expressways heap with wrecks of armored and supply vehicles that tried to reinforce the garrison. Civilians are forced to take up arms for positions smashed by heavy fire—or serve as beasts of burden.\n\nYesterday an air-assault brigade won great merit: before reserve echelons could arrive, they risked a heliborne drop behind the lines and took the Supreme Court and National Diet within a day, even seizing confidential files in Diet offices—evacuation plans and hideouts for nearly all senior officials and officers. They had planned to disguise themselves as civilians and flee to “friendly countries” in Europe—now none will escape. Tai Pact deployments are in chaos. Guided by UAVs and forward recon, a JGSDF mech division slated to form the Imperial Palace defensive line was caught by 203 mm fires before it could assemble—opening a gash in the palace line. The remnants fall back to Ginza, Mitsukoshi-mae, and Akihabara, buying time for a few surviving armored divisions and Australian reinforcements to flee the metro.\n\n“From higher: fire prep complete.

These Japanese came up with quite the tricks to worship ghosts,” quips gun boss Zhao Hansong on destroyer Dalian’s bridge, watching the UAV’s optical feed. “But no amount of worship will save them.”\n\n“Too much chatter,” the captain grins, then addresses the bridge: “Comrades, today we destroy the symbol of Japanese militarism: battleship Mikasa. You saw it—militarists still use this ship to brainwash the people. The Center deems its ‘heritage value’ irrelevant; given its symbolic history, our ship is ordered to dismantle this iron coffin. The Party and State have entrusted us with this honor. Do we have confidence?”\n“Confidence!”\n“Weihai, livestream status?”\n“Picture clear, link stable—you may fire at will.”\n“Good!

  gaw.304.d: "Once, Japan’s ‘mighty’ air arm fed Sasaki’s boundless confidence. Long before the war over the Taiwan Strait, every F-2 sortie over the East China Sea had him daydreaming how his ‘three thousand sea eagles’ would smash to the seabed the ‘hybrid of Russian and Israeli tech’ across the water.\n\nBut the world is material—it won’t change for fantasies. Sasaki knows that better now. Outside the shelter, distant tank farms burn; firefighters cannot approach, much less fight the blaze.\n\n“We won’t need that fuel anyway…” says the squadron leader, voice flat. “Only your F-2 is left. Today you’re the only one who can fly. The Chinese cruise missiles hit the shelters again—their reinforcement was useless.”\n\nSasaki forces a smile. He knows what that means. F-35s and Shinshin appear ever less; PLA multirole fighters now fly pure air-to-ground loads, disdaining even a single self-defense AAM.\n\nHe climbs into the cockpit, prepared to die for the Emperor in this fight.\n\nCold-start checklist: battery voltage nominal; fire test normal; APU up. As he hits engine ignition, darkness and silence swallow the hangar without warning.\n\nGround crew inform him: a tiny point along the kilometers of F-2 wiring finally burnt through after years of overload. The jet will never fly again. PLAAF strikes have destroyed every spare in this Kyushu mountain base.\n\nBeneath him lies nothing but scrap metal—painted with a hinomaru."

  gaw.305.t: "Falcon of the South China Sea"
  gaw.305.d: "The South China Sea skyline was torn by the roar of jets. ASDF ace pilot Takatsukasa Tsukikage cruised above in her F-35. Early in the war, her F-35 squadron prowled the nearby airspace—downing many Thai JAS 39s and Vietnamese Su-30s and even inflicting losses on Singapore’s own F-35s. But the situation had reversed sharply, and their operating area had shrunk drastically.\n\nThis was another bold mission. Japan and Australia had massed every remaining F-35, including Tsukikage’s flight, to skim the sea at low altitude toward ASEAN’s logistics hub in the Philippines. “All units be advised: no hostile contacts in the vicinity,” the AEW’s encrypted call came over the net. Her HDD datalink picture also showed nothing. “If this works, maybe ASEAN’s advance will finally slow,” she thought—without relaxing for a moment.\n\nSuddenly a banshee shriek filled her cockpit—the RWR. Training-reflexes took over: a barrel roll and a string of flares. Several AAMs ripped past her tail and detonated over the water; fragments tore into her jet. The range spared the vitals, but a ragged trail of holes now scarred her aircraft. Compared with the other F-35 pilots blown to pieces, Tsukikage was the lucky one.\n\n“AWACS! Where is the enemy package?” she called coolly—no reply. The RWR howled again: at least six active seeker signatures lit the display. She yanked the ejection handle; moments later, PL-15s from multiple vectors shredded the F-35.\n\nSuspended beneath her parachute, Tsukikage would never know the truth: from the outset, ASEAN had laid a meticulous trap for her formation.\n\nFar away aboard an ASEAN AWACS, a steady female voice reached the commander’s headset: “Kunlun, this is Yulong-01. My squadron has annihilated the enemy package as planned. We hold air superiority.”"

We’ve got to finish it. I won’t be home for dinner,” the young operator shouted over the din in the shop. The old man on the line winced.\n\n“Sairinmu, night after night it’s overtime—pay and production, eh?

  gaw.307.t: "Defying Fate (I)"
  gaw.307.d: "“Sigh… the squad leader—he’s gone.” Noda checked for breath, then shook his head. Moments earlier, an FPV had struck their semi-underground shelter. With surgical precision the drone pilot threaded a small opening and detonated right in front of the squad leader.\n\nThough their leader had just died, no grief or rage showed on the soldiers’ faces. The man who had routinely abused them inspired no affection or awe. Yet there was no relief either—only confusion. The petty tyrant was gone, but the war that tormented them all would not end with one scoundrel’s death. Before them stretched only a void.\n\nNoda noticed every set of eyes turning his way. He realized he was the only veteran left—a man who by rights should have died years ago on foreign soil, a “coward” who somehow hadn’t.\n\nYears before, Noda had gone to a small island called Taiwan, a JSDF soldier sent to a strange place to defend Japan’s “freedom and democracy” and its sea lifeline. He once naively believed that with resolve for “freedom and democracy” and the will to “defend” his home, he could dance with the red dragon in the island’s mountains and wear it down. Torrents of shells and missiles from nowhere crushed that illusion. He blacked out in an explosion… and woke up in the infirmary of a POW camp.\n\nHe had not died for “freedom and democracy.” He was a prisoner. In that brief time, he saw these enemies not only treat their wounds but feed them three meals better than the JSDF garrison back home. There was no cruelty—only daily drills, labor, and re-education classes delivered in halting Japanese. He barely listened—enemies were enemies, or so he thought.\n\nA month later he stepped off the repatriation ship. No flowers for “heroes”—only some official’s dull speech and empty praise. Then came “discharge”: a meager, docked payout. Worse, once outside the wire, his sterling pre-service diploma and résumé meant nothing. Employers glanced at his CV and binned it: “We don’t hire cowards.” Family barred the door—“You are our shame.”\n\nAll because he lived, instead of becoming bones in the grass on that unfamiliar island."

  gaw.308.d: "By the time he returned from his thoughts, the words were already out. The survivors first stared, then fell silent. Shocked, yes—but none could deny it: they were sick of war.\n\n“The squad leader and the brass say we must defend our ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy.’ But have we ever felt free? Ever felt democracy?”\n\nHe marveled at his own courage—such “unpatriotic” words—yet he did not stop.\n\n“Before this, some of you were nine-to-five office drudges, some farmers, some factory hands; some were students or shut-ins. But we all feel it: a convenience-store curry costs more every day; the shows we love vanish from TV; power cuts strike without warning at night; the women in the parks sell themselves in growing numbers. Worse, the money in our hands scarcely counts as money anymore. And the Diet? It drags us from our homes, dumps us in strange camps, and orders us to fight for Japan—fight for ‘freedom and democracy.’”\n\nHe grew more impassioned until emotion finally broke through.\n\n“So ‘freedom’ means conscripting us, letting officers abuse us at will, flogging us for nothing, and paying a pittance? ‘Democracy’ means a clique of hypocrites shouting ‘for Japan’ and ‘for the Emperor’—then unilaterally plunging into wars that have nothing to do with us? Shipping us to Taiwan and Korea to die? Letting the flames reach our homes?”\n\nHe paused for breath. Silence settled—poised on the edge of rupture.\n\nAfter a while Noda spoke gently: “Do we accept this quietly—or resist the fate forced on us and live?”\n\n“Then, senpai… what do we do?” asked a recruit who was clearly still in high school.\n\n“Simple: surrender to the PLA.” He tore down the red-blot flag on the wall, ripped out the blood-red disk, and flung it to the floor.\n\n“I came back alive from Taiwan only thanks to them. Without their help, I’d have been gone years ago.”\n\nHe wrenched off a table leg, tied on a white cloth, walked to the door, and heaved the iron slab open.\n\n“Let’s go.

A corner tag marked the location: a port in Mumbai.\n\nTwo pirates, gleaming knives in hand, faced an old man—filthy, wrapped in a tattered, colorful blanket—who knelt before them weeping and kowtowing. All three spoke English—badly. Thankfully the internet’s bodhisattvas, the subtitle teams, had already provided bilingual captions.\n\n“Hurry up!” the leader barked at the start. “Hand over everything valuable on you!”\n\n“Please!” The old man pointed to a sack nearby stuffed with wallets and cash. “I truly have nothing else!”\n\n“Didn’t you say you’re the supreme leader of Tibet?” snarled the other pirate. “And a leader of a PRC autonomous region has only this? Lying at death’s door—you must have a death wish!”\n\n“Spare me!” The old man flung himself flat, knocking his head on the ground. “The Communists advanced too quickly—we had no time to gather more. But I swear, if you take me to Europe, I’ll raise donations online from my believers—any sum you want! Euros, rubles, RMB—a million, two million!”\n\nThey roared with laughter. The leader ripped away the ragged cloth; the old man’s withered back shivered in the sea breeze. “And when you reach Europe, where do we find you?” He set the blade to the man’s throat. “Didn’t you say you had many followers? Tell them now—on camera. Money. Two days.”\n\nThe old man scrambled before the lens. Viewers finally saw his face: the fugitive 14th Dalai Lama—Tenzin Gyatso.\n\nThe “living Buddha,” stripped of hauteur, knelt like a mangy cur—sobbing in Tibetan to the people of Tibet to donate and save him; then in Chinese he kowtowed to the Party Center, begging Beijing to ransom him, promising to accept the people’s judgment.\n\nWhen he finished wailing, the pirates spoke again: “We sail for Europe now. You have two days. If the money doesn’t hit this account, we’ll tie iron hooks to your feet and feed you to the fish.” The clip ended.\n\nThere was no sequel. But days later, sharp-eyed netizens dug up a Mumbai newspaper story: “Headless Corpse at the Port.” Plainly the “living Buddha’s” pull was not what he’d promised—and he paid the dearest price."

  gaw.310.d: "Looking at Kinkaku-ji—its gold leaf stripped by a bankrupt government—Li Shaolin almost laughed. His father was an East Asian cultural historian; by osmosis he knew the region’s landmarks well. But to feed Japan’s pitiful war machine, every valuable artifact had been seized, discounted, and sold abroad for cash.\n\nLi jumped down from an IFV—no powered exoskeleton today, just a field uniform. Not so his squad: armored up, stylus-toting troopers debussed in sequence, while a tank battalion of thirty-five new MBTs sealed Kinkaku-ji tight. Overhead, a dense mesh of UAVs watched—enough to catch even a stray cat.\n\nMonks filed out and stood in a line before the temple, chanting with closed eyes. The abbot stepped forward, staff in hand, and pressed his palms together to Li.\n\n“Honored layman, to what do we owe your presence?”\n\nLi glanced over the monks. They did not seem hostile—but they positioned themselves to block the entrance. “The PLA respects culture and protects local customs and heritage. The world’s historical treasures must not be destroyed by war,” he said evenly—and fixed the abbot with a look. “But when it comes to Kinkaku-ji—does that ‘heritage’ include sheltering shogunate generals as well?”\n\n“You jest. This temple has taken no side,” the abbot fingered his beads. “Your accusation springs from delusion.”\n\n“In that case, look.” Li raised a display before him. The image showed a dead young couple shielding their child, a crude bomb half-strapped to the child’s back. Nearby, civilians lay prone along the road—shot while fleeing a garrison. Blood pooled and reflected the eaves of the Imperial Palace.\n\n“Kyoto’s civilians, under direct orders from Chief of Staff Nagumo, have been conscripted into ‘sacrifice squads’ for suicide attacks. Any who balk or try to flee are executed on the spot. Is this what the sangha tolerates? We have precise intelligence that Nagumo and several officers are hiding inside Kinkaku-ji. Abbot, are you—”\n\n“Say no more. Come with me.” Pain carved the abbot’s face. Eyes shut tight, he gestured for the monks to part. Li turned to his troops: “Assault teams!

Born to a military family, his grandfather Park Jeong-hun had joined Chun Doo-hwan in the 12/12 coup—branding into him the creed that \"soldiers exist to fight communism and defend the nation.\"\n\nThat evening the sky was leaden, clouds pressing low. Park and his men mustered in the hangar. After the U.S. civil war and hasty pullout, heaps of heavy gear had been abandoned; Korea had picked up treasure by the ton—including even America’s most secret “stealth Black Hawk.” Park scanned his well-equipped troopers, drew a deep breath, and repeated the brief: \"Remember: the goal is the enemy IFF module. Fast. Precise. No failure. Loyalty!\"\n\nHelos skimmed treetops. Through the window, night was ink; in the cabin only engine hum and heavy breathing. The drone wreck’s oily smoke was faintly visible. Park clenched a fist: \"So far so good. With that module, we can flip the war.\"\n\nThe calm didn’t last. Urgent tones blared from the cockpit. Fireballs flickered outside; missiles with searing tails lunged in. A long-hidden air-defense cluster wove a lethal net of tracers.

The \"gap\" was deliberate.\n\nDarkness closed in.

Near midnight, a rough English voice woke me; PLA soldiers were already in front of me. At first I thought some high-caste clown with a weird accent was there to have his fun, so I ignored him and tried to sleep. Then…\"\n\nHe gave a helpless smile. Until you saw it, you wouldn’t believe the PLA could ghost around behind their vaunted ‘strong line’—and, in the night, take them prisoner without a shot fired.\n\n\"They treat us well. No beef in the meals; lots of vegetables. Here I get good food—an enlisted man eats as well as a captain—instead of choking down the same instant noodles and sugar blocks every day… Unthinkable for low-caste grunts in the Indian Army.\"\n\nHe lifted the boxed milk the PLA had handed out, took a sip, and studied the carton with feeling. The milk was so white—like it could dispel the black fog in his heart—that he couldn’t put it down.\n\n\"In my old unit, officers and high-castes humiliated and abused me. If they were in a bad mood, they beat me with sticks. They broke one of my fingers—said I was no different from a pig or a dog. Now I understand: we’re all people. Why are they ‘noble’? Why do they eat fresh food while we eat expired noodles? Damn it—I should have defected on day one.\"\n\n‘Defect to the light’—a phrase a new Chinese friend taught him.

They rallied on and off campus with red banners and helmets, faced down police, and clashed in blood; casualties mounted.\n\nEx–Red Army members also grabbed cached weapons and headed to Todai as ad-hoc fighters. Unexpectedly, they took no offensive action—merely stood guard at every point on campus, as if the Red Army now accepted unified command.\n\nThe JCP was the only party to voice support, repeatedly condemning government oppression and posting that “this is the will of the people—we urge the government to end this senseless war.” Rumor had it the JCP secretly funded and dispatched organizers to guide a peaceful march.\n\nSince Tokyo is the nation’s heart, the government vowed to crush this “China-orchestrated conspiracy.” Local videos already showed troops deploying near the campus."

Put the carrier and cover forces here—clear of the storm’s worst and able to support the front.\"\n\nAs the carrier steered to station, tension spiked in the sonar room aboard FFG Taizhou (Type-054B). The operator locked on the display, eyes widening as he hit the alarm: \"Bearing 187—four Mogami-class frigates—range two-two nautical miles!\"\n\nCaptain Chen Feng’s eyes flashed; hands gripped the chair. \"So the brats learned a trick—using the storm to blunt radar and fight a gun duel? Let’s show them the ‘rogue of the waves’! Railguns to charge!\"\n\nThree rail mounts slewed southeast; blue-white arcs danced in the rain. Gun Captain Li Chuang snapped: \"Target set—fire!\" At 120 MJ, three tungsten darts leapt like lightning at Mach 10. Ten seconds later, three sky-high plumes rose twenty miles off.\n\nThe first Mogami’s flight deck tore away; its burning helicopter fell into the sea. Before the enemy could react, a second volley arrived—two ships mission-killed. The fourth fled, only to meet a Type-059 destroyer’s EM-boosted missile. One blast, and the raiding group was gone.\n\nThe storm abated; clouds broke. Stripped of cover, the Japanese fleet panicked and turned to run.\n\nWang clenched a fist before the ops board: \"No escapes. All units—pursue and finish them!\"\n\nThe Type-005 battle group swung onto intercept, knifing through the swell. Deck crews launched the air wing—their climb a blade into the sky. Escorts ran high speed off the flanks, wakes writing a chapter of victory."

Aircraft are armed and ready to depart on planned routes at any time. However, intel indicates the JMSDF is urgently massing; some vessels have left port—they may sense our move.\" A signals officer hurried in, saluted, and delivered the update.\n\nWang frowned slightly, gaze fixed on the screen as he thought aloud: \"…Order all units to accelerate replenishment—finish within one hour. Have intel track the enemy continuously and analyze likely courses of action. Send the submarines early to their stations to lurk, severing the enemy’s retreat and supply lines. Chief of Staff, report our actions to the Joint Staff.\"\n\nOrders rippled outward. Keyboards clacked, voices relayed commands—the command post became a tightly scored prelude to the enemy fleet’s final act.\n\nA young staffer rushed up with a brief: \"Report: latest meteorology shows no strong convection in the target sea area. Weather is ideal for naval operations.\"\n\nWang considered, then said, \"Tell the weather bureau to maintain continuous monitoring and assess impacts. The units must not grow lax—be ready for contingencies at all times.\" The staffer saluted and hurried off.\n\nTime passed; resupply neared completion. Wang looked around the command center and raised his voice: \"Comrades, the Republic’s honor and dignity ride on this battle.

The core of the original Nagoya garrison—the 10th Division—was annihilated by our army in the Kyoto campaign. Enemy defenses toward Nagoya consisted mainly of ad-hoc mobilized reserve units formed by expanding mixed regiments under the Central Army, reinforced by elements of the Eastern Army’s westward-moving 12th Brigade to form a Nagoya garrison group.\n\nOur forward reconnaissance units recently detected large enemy armored and mechanized elements in the Suwa–Kanagawa area. Air Force intelligence assesses these as Northern Army formations redeploying south to reinforce the Tokyo area. Identified units include the 7th Division and the 5th and 11th Brigades, plus several mixed brigades with provisional designations—combat power judged weak.\nThe Nagoya garrison group failed to mount an effective defense. Most units were reservists lacking tactical proficiency and will to resist; equipment was mothballed stock. Only a portion defending Chūbu Centrair International Airport fought with determination and caused us notable difficulty. All other units were encircled and destroyed in detail. Part of the 12th Brigade withdrew along Route 19 into the Hida Mountains, attempting to rally stragglers for a last stand.\n\nWith Nagoya secured, the approach corridor into the Chūbu–Tokyo megalopolis is now fully open. The Eastern Theater proposes a combined strike pushing on Aichi with heavy and medium combined-arms brigades, while light combined-arms brigades conduct search-and-advance toward Suwa. The enemy Northern Army’s southward relief has relatively high morale and armor density. Vanguard units will advance cautiously to avoid needless losses; the rear will expedite rail and road repairs to ensure smooth forward logistics.\nRespectfully submitted—awaiting Joint Staff directives."

While the brief was relayed to all senior commanders, he ran the checklist one last time in his mind.\n\n\"Before the landings, the Navy, Air Force, Rocket Force, and DPRK long-range strike units will conduct sustained fires against enemy forces on Kyushu—degrading counterattack capacity and wrecking coastal defenses. The amphibious assault will unfold in two phases.\"\n\n\"Phase One: advance echelons open and secure beachheads, then push steadily inland. Three tasks: (1) Seize cities and ports to favor our follow-on lift. (2) Exploit thinly held nodes—towns around coastal cities—to land and envelop inland. (3) Compress the enemy’s core defenses and threaten their flanks; blocking detachments and SOF will delay rear-area reinforcements.\"\n\n\"Phase Two: follow-on forces land on the established lodgments and, with the spearheads, strike enemy troop concentrations in cities and strongpoints, routing or destroying them. From there, units may continue inland as appropriate to set conditions to expel PDO forces from all of Kyushu. Air-naval coordination will…\"\n\nWhen the brief concluded, the theater commander nodded slightly. The unease lingered, but reason told him every factor had been weighed.

In conflict, Indian forces could sever our sustainment routes and strike forward against our convoys from this geographic springboard.\n\nII. Objective\nSeize full control of the Andaman Islands in the shortest time; destroy or expel Indian units; eliminate their ability to menace our strategic corridor.\n\nIII. Phases\nPhase 1 — Suppress & Paralyze:\nRocket Force saturates key targets—runways, SAM sites, radars. After BDA, PLAAF strikes remaining assets to break IAF/air defenses and command systems.\n\nPhase 2 — Seize Islands & Ports:\nUnder absolute sea-air fire superiority, conduct multi-point amphibious landings. Marines and Army units coordinate to destroy resistance and secure principal islands/harbors rapidly, preventing organized reinforcement or counterattack.\n\nPhase 3 — Consolidate & Fortify:\nRepair/upgrade airfields, ports, and defenses.

The defensive belt thrown up outside the city by the Northern Army’s 5th and 11th Brigades—rushed south to reinforce the Central Area—has been broken. The Higashi-Kanagawa–Yokohama National University area was secured by our forces at noon yesterday. A preliminary perimeter is now in place. Remnants of the enemy 11th Brigade are fleeing toward Yokosuka, attempting to slip across the strait between Yokosuka and Hota to the Bōsō Peninsula. To prevent escape, the East Sea Fleet and Eastern Theater Air Force have begun a tight blockade and mining of the strait.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipyard at Yokohama Port was demolished by the JGSDF’s engineering regiment during the battle; current assessment is that repair is not worthwhile—postwar rebuild is preferable. Sea mines inside and outside Yokohama Port have been cleared; temporary piers can be emplaced and throughput routed straight to the front. Compared with routing via the Osaka–Kyoto corridor, this will save roughly 150 km of overland transport and free rail lift.\n\nIn this operation we shattered the 7th Division and destroyed most of the 5th and 11th Brigades. Japan’s three prewar standing armored formations have now been mauled or annihilated. After Yokohama, the JGSDF has in effect lost the capacity to meet our large field armored groupings in open battle; they can only echelon defenses on urban belts and mountains. Their remaining armor cannot form a coherent shock force against our operational lines; follow-on offensives can consider more aggressive action.\n\nThe Eastern Theater Army will continue forward to cut Tokyo’s links to Saitama–Utsunomiya, leaving only a land corridor toward Kashima.

Before H-hour, the enemy massed elements of the 4th and 8th Divisions, the 103rd/104th Brigades, and a reconstituted ROK I Corps. The 103rd/104th Brigades manned coastal belts, key road hubs, dual-use ports, and suburban checkpoints; the 4th Division sat central as a mobile reserve; parts of the 8th Division held the south; remaining ROK troops blocked the north; others formed depth reserves.\n\nGiven the city’s size and complex environs, we employed joint sea–air–rocket support and multi-point, simultaneous penetrations by landing echelons. Prior to landing, navy and air force conducted sustained strikes on key nodes inside Fukuoka to attrit counterattack forces and sow deception, while interdicting transport hubs across Kyushu. Rocket Force units deployed on the southern peninsula and KPA long-range fires executed pre-landing fire curtains, with effective strikes and EW against enemy C2.\n\nInitial landings succeeded as planned—defenders were broken and beachheads pushed inland. Forces ashore from the outskirts compressed the perimeter and then drove on the core. Previously infiltrated special operations teams guided long-range fires, raided thin nodes in the city center, degraded coastal artillery, and opened gaps for thrusting columns.\n\nAfter the coastal belt collapsed, the 4th Division counterattacked. Our spearheads fought street to street, taking checks and withdrawing briefly. With armored reinforcement, lines stabilized and advanced again.\n\nOnce the enemy realized the coast was gone, they massed on central blocks and exploited urban structure to delay us. Small ambush teams inflicted casualties.\n\nWith our urban-warfare specialists, reinforcing KPA units, and swarming UAVs committed, resistance collapsed. The central line was pierced; flanking landing echelons completed a partial envelopment and threatened retreat routes.\n\nEnemy remnants abandoned heavy kit and exfiltrated in groups, leaving stay-behind squads. Our artillery, UAVs, and Rocket Force kept striking, achieving the campaign’s objective of seizing Fukuoka. Follow-on forces are now landing through the port to support operations across Kyushu."

On Mt. Maya and Futatabi-yama, artillery and radars covered all Osaka Bay. In the city, they built strongpoints amid high-rises, emplaced bunkers, and pre-set charges on key infrastructure.\n\nPer our plan, Wave 1 Rocket Force salvos saturated air defenses on Rokko and adjacent nodes; PLAAF EW packages suppressed the Awaji–Kobe airspace, crippling PDO C2. Wave 2 followed: PLAN surface combatants used anti-radiation missiles to finish coastal ASCM sites; bombers dropped penetrators on the Maya underground command post. We then held full control of air, sea, and spectrum.\n\nMobilization complete, the southern landing group hit on two axes. The western group feinted against Awaji’s north sands to draw reserves; the eastern, led by mechanized assault echelons, forced the beaches at Suma. Engineers cut six deep lanes; enemy counterattacks from artificial-island container yards were blocked by our long-range rocket brigades. The bulk of our force unloaded and gained numeric superiority.\n\nAt dawn day two, we advanced on Kobe Port. SOF used micro-UAVs to scan heat sources, cueing ATGMs to clear barricades; mech infantry “breach walls and courtyards” to bypass mined streets; engineers blasted logistic corridors. Enemy fell back to Shinkaichi; our air assault battalions inserted to their rear and encircled the remnants.

Yoichi, removing threats to landing sites. With expected effects achieved, we began multi-site landings without meeting formed resistance—enemy failed to demolish port facilities, greatly easing heavy-equipment offload. Forward HQs deployed quickly, establishing a forward line near Momijiyama.\n\nBefore dawn D+1, armor columns advanced via Teine and Ishikari approaches. South of the Agricultural Experiment Park, building height spiked and visibility dropped; enemy AT teams scored hits.

By noon, enemy fell back to Okadama–Odori Park and massed 2nd Division mech to ambush our forward brigades west of Hokkaido University. ISR fixed precise positions via UAV imagery; our long-range rockets emplaced at the Shinko plant inflicted effective losses. Our air assault seized New Chitose from the outskirts of Eniwa, cutting southern withdrawal. By dusk we held Odori Park and the TV Tower; most die-hards from 2nd Division were destroyed by loitering UAVs while fleeing toward Takikawa. The 21st Composite remnants, encircled at Kitahiroshima, surrendered.

Under joint saturated fires, Sino–Korean echelons used fast landing craft and amphibious tanks to run multi-wave, rapid assaults. Our mixed landing group first secured a bridgehead on Yeongjongdo. Engineers emplaced two large pontoon bridges within three hours to push heavy kit ashore. Enemy coastal works returned weak fire; with heavy elements arriving, we advanced.

The airport–Queanbeyan corridor was seeded with minefields and AT ditches, backed by SP artillery. Semi-permanent works and tunnels knit the Parliamentary Triangle. The enemy concept relied on urban attrition to buy time for NSW remnants to relieve the city.\n\nOn D-Day, Rocket Force units in Papua New Guinea punched through air defenses with hypersonics, destroying the Mount Coree early-warning radar. Stealth packages “silent-hunted” at night to shatter air opposition and seize the sky. EW smothered Canberra’s spectrum; the PDO command net was down for two hours. With PLAAF control established, key barriers to deep thrusts were removed.\n\nGround action then began. Helicopter-borne air assault penetrated low through Brindabella gorges, seizing the Australian War Memorial and Mount Ainslie observation hub; the eastern armor group broke the Kings Ave line from the Federal Highway.

Precision strikes collapsed Old Parliament House ventilation shafts; underground HQ exits were sealed. The SE Area commander and staff were captured while attempting to exfil via emergency routes pre-covered by our ambush teams at Commonwealth Park. By late night, the Australian Defence Force Academy raised a white flag; organized resistance ended. The National Gallery, High Court, and other key sites were transferred intact with zero collateral damage.\n\nSouthern Theater now controls the federal government precincts; engineers are restoring infrastructure while a provisional military administration stands up."

The defense used Port Phillip Bay and outer belts in three tiers: outer—mines from Mornington Peninsula to Geelong and mobile coastal missile launchers on the coastal hills; middle—Dandenong Ranges with quarry tunnels as CPs/artillery sites; core—a vertical fire web from Federation Square to Southern Cross Station. The enemy had four U.S.-made BMD sets, 36 SP guns, and EW units—aiming to bog us down in an urban quagmire.\n\nAt 0200 D-Day, Rocket Force elements in PNG with South Sea Fleet strike groups conducted precision blows against hardened nodes, destroying the Dandenong command site and BMD assets. AWACS with EW sealed Bass Strait; heavy UAVs launched cruise missiles to kill Geelong coastal ASCM sites. A long-range rocket brigade laid smoke over approach lanes to mask landing routes.\n\nAt midday, Marines landed. The main effort hit Williamstown Beach; under gunship cover, first-wave echelons seized and held the beachhead within 30 minutes. On the flank, SOF and air assault helilifted to the Dandenong ridgeline, taking the 516 OP. At 14:21 our tank columns pushed along Princes Highway into the eastern suburbs and were ambushed at Dandenong Racecourse; ISR-strike UAVs fixed the fire sacks and guided counterfires—AUS 3rd Brigade’s armor battalion was destroyed. By 18:43, two combined-arms battalions, one SOF battalion, and accompanying SHORAD were established on planned lines.\n\nClearance began that night. In the east, SOF used decoys to draw out sniper teams, then killed them with precision ATGM shots. In the west, armored engineers breached under cover, blew the Flinders Street Station tunnels, sealed underground PDO shelters, then poured fuel to compel surrender. By dusk day two, remnants fell back to Queen Victoria Market for a final stand; a mech infantry company, tanks leading, split the street line while artillery delivered intimidation fires. At 22:14, Southern Command Lt. Gen. Rodrigues capitulated. Enemy KIA ~3,200; POW 6,462; our losses below estimates. Seven Melbourne port berths and Tullamarine air base are fully secured."

Defenders: 1st Armored Cavalry Regiment, 12th Coastal Defense Brigade, and mercenaries. The Stuart Highway was blocked with AT tetrahedrons; artillery dotted the Litchfield hills with wide fields of fire. Urban defenses centered on the port, using Town Hall, Stokes Hill oil tanks, and other RC structures, backed by eight air-defense sets, two counter-battery radars, and ~90 AFVs.\n\nAs operations opened, our covering force closed the beaches, using shipboard fires and carrier air to knock out key strongpoints and armor. Landing echelons executed multi-wave assaults—main beach at Mantalanka on Fannie Bay’s east. Despite stubborn resistance from hardened buildings, the vanguard closed to breach and destroyed nodal fires, clearing the way. Under gunship cover, SOF and air assault seized Darwin Airport, suppressing defenders within 30 minutes. Our armored spearhead drove down Roebuck Bay Ave into the north suburbs, mech 3rd Battalion smashing three belts and repelling eight counterattacks, setting conditions for advantage. By dusk, main forces completed assault posture; the Stuart Highway junction was in our hands and sustainment opened within hours.\n\nNext day we shifted to block-by-block fighting. Armor and artillery combined direct and high-angle fires to crush positions; IFVs with exoskeleton infantry swept street by street. At the oil depot, engineers blew the Stokes Hill perimeter; the garrison surrendered on the spot. At dawn the following day, mercenaries fell back to Port Darwin Berth 5’s container stacks; our armor frontally assaulted and cleared them. At noon, Brig. Harrison feigned surrender at the HQ, attempted a suicide attack, and was killed with his staff. The port’s nine deepwater berths and the air base runway were taken intact.\n\nEngineers have begun dredging to restore throughput rapidly. Joint logistics will build a Timor Sea ring sustainment corridor centered on Darwin. Main forces have reconstituted and are moving to preplanned assembly areas."

President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Youxia, Defense Minister Li Zuocheng, and other Party and state leaders attended alongside leaders and military delegations from ASEAN partner nations.\n\nThis parade set multiple records in PRC history: total marching strength reached 35,000, including a 5,000-strong combined formation from multiple ASEAN states; the air echelon fielded 300+ aircraft; and 1,000+ sets of new equipment rolled in the ground columns.\n\nShowcasing the fruits of defense and military reform since 2024, exoskeleton infantry systems, intelligent touch-designated rifles, and sixth-generation stealth fighters—J-36 and J-50—made their public debut as the sword safeguarding the nation, the people, and world peace.\n\nFrom the Tiananmen rostrum, President Xi paid tribute to the people’s heroes who fell defeating the enemy and to innocents harmed by war. He stressed that over eighty hard-fought years, the Chinese people—unyielding—met risk and challenge, ultimately earning a just victory shoulder-to-shoulder with ASEAN partners, proving no force can halt the united Asian people’s march for peace. Looking ahead, China will work with ASEAN to advance postwar reconstruction and build a peaceful, prosperous Asia-Pacific homeland.\n\nUnder the command of JSD Chief of Staff Gen. Liu Zhenli, forty-two ground formations and twenty-seven air echelons passed in review. PLAAF Commander Gen. Chang Dingqiu personally flew a J-10 display jet to lead the August-1 aerobatic team, followed by a sixth-gen formation of J-36s and J-50s sweeping over Chang’an Avenue in cruise.\n\nClosing the parade, the “Asia-Pacific Community of Shared Future” mass formation brought together over ten thousand civil representatives from ASEAN nations. As 100,000 doves and 100,000 colored balloons lifted skyward, leaders on the rostrum waved to the crowds. This grand festival of peace both affirmed the region’s resolve to safeguard stability and carried the common hopes of all peoples for a better life.\n\nAcross the vast Asian land, people celebrated this hard-won victory and peace with inexpressible emotion and gratitude—a brilliant feat forged by the blood and sacrifice of countless heroes.\n\nIn this solemn and hope-filled hour, hands joined across nations, all pray that a more prosperous, harmonious, and bright world may come sooner through daily toil."

  gaw.2000.d: "War across Asia spread like a wildfire. As time wore on, confrontation between the East Asia Collective Defense Pact and the Pacific Treaty Organization escalated relentlessly.\n\nWith earlier preparations, the PTO held certain advantages and notched initial battlefield gains, placing EDIA under great pressure.\n\nThen a sudden decision changed everything. After deliberation, China—the leading power of EDIA—opted to conduct a comprehensive nuclear strike on the PTO. Senior leadership in four PTO states remains missing; governance has largely collapsed, swathes of territory have fallen under ad-hoc martial rule, and violent clashes have erupted. Industrial hubs were engulfed by nuclear fire; factories vanished in heat and shock; aircraft and ships perished at bases; munitions depots cooked off; most radar sites were obliterated. Bridges fell, rails twisted, communications went dark; cities lost contact; people stumbled through fear and confusion.\n\nCaught completely off guard, the PTO saw its strategic edge vanish like a mirage. Amid the chaos unleashed by China’s strike, EDIA forces seized the moment, ordered a general counteroffensive, and broke through at multiple axes. Yet the war is not over. Though grievously hurt, the PTO retains fragments of strength and potential.\n\nThe flames over Asia still burn. Peace’s dawn remains veiled by war’s clouds. The course of this conflict is uncertain; the great game continues at a fever pitch. Asia’s future is a fog-bound sea; countless fates will rise and fall in the whirlpool of war.\n\nAs Asia blazes, the world can only wait."

By habit, EDIA would send only small parties to harass lines twenty kilometers out. But today the battlefield was silent.\n\n“Sergeant Seshi, report.” Old Singh crackled over the landline.\n\n“All normal, Sahib. When will this war ever end?” Seshi, bored, tried to chat.\n\nSince the war began, EDIA’s jamming never left the sky. It had been ages since Seshi heard from home.\n\n“Confirm, Seshi—really nothing?” Singh’s tone tightened. “Look again. Use that brain you battled the Redcaps with!”\n\nSeshi scanned the horizon.

Then—\n\n“No…that’s—” His eyes locked north.\n\nA brilliant star appeared beside the sun in broad daylight, outshining it.\n\n“Woooo—”\n\nSirens shrieked from the city behind. The volume drove Seshi to his knees, hands clamped over his ears.\n\nThe wait in the shelter was endless. A muffled detonation rolled up from the south; the ground heaved; the far city had been struck.\n\nSeshi tried to rise, but training welded him into a curl. In the roar he couldn’t hear Singh at all. Light grew harsher; the ringing sharpened; his heart hammered.\n\nWind and sand came screaming. The world shook. Then the blast ebbed. He forced himself up.

Over thirty million people tried to send farewell messages in those two hours; most never posted—lost with their owners’ blood and tears, joy and grief, good and evil, guilt and judgment—consumed by the lands that bore them.\n\nLight and heat seared Mount Kosciuszko; the gate that bottled rainclouds over Australia’s interior was razed.

After the pandemic, oil shortages, and financial instability, the Bangladeshi government had already collapsed and could mount no effective resistance. Indian representatives insist the deployment secures their borders and regional stability.\n\nAnalysts note that after the Indo-Pak war, India sought ways to regain regional influence; the pivot to the PTO and the move into Bangladesh reflect a broader strategy aimed at Pakistan and China.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister Jaishankar defended the step: “Partnership with the ‘PTO’ strengthens our security and redresses historic injustices we face in the region.” A former Bangladeshi official, requesting anonymity, denounced the intervention as “an assault on our sovereignty” and appealed for international support."
