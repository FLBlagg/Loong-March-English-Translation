  PRC_tw_GUI: "The Taiwan Question"
  PRC_tw_GUI_desc: "§3Taiwan§! is the question we can never sidestep on the road to national rejuvenation. This rich, beautiful island remains the §glast redoubt of separatists§!—and the clearest proof of outside interference in China’s internal affairs. Under the §G“pro-independence” DPP§!, the détente that followed the §Y1992 Consensus§! has unraveled. §3“Peaceful reunification”§! remains our stated preference, but we have never renounced the use of force.\n\n\n§YNational Readiness Level:§! §R[?PRC_progressbar_var]§!\nFor more than seventy years, the §RChinese government§! has never abandoned the option of §Rusing force to achieve reunification§!. This value reflects our preparedness for a §3Taiwan Strait conflict§!. The higher the readiness, the more bonuses we gain in wartime—at the cost of some economic drag in selected regions.\n\n§YPublic Support for Reunification in Taiwan:§! [TFR_PRC_TW_PSL]\n[TFR_PRC_TW_PSL_DESC_SL]\n\n§YStatus of Kinmen Garrison:§! [PRC_TW_AUM_SL]\nIf tensions spike, retaking Kinmen would be straightforward—but a voluntary stand-down by its garrison would shock island opinion and work to our advantage.\n\n§YReconstruction Progress:§!

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_11_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_TW_NoPeaceThen\n\n\n\n\nThis was our last effort to settle matters peacefully.

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_18: "No SAR—An Autonomous Region"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_18_desc: "If force becomes necessary, the ‘one country, two systems’ framework no longer applies. After careful consideration, the Center will establish a Taiwan Autonomous Region—modeled on Xinjiang’s approach—ensuring ‘Taiwan people administering Taiwan’ under Party leadership while rapidly dismantling separatism and extremism."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_19: "Intensify Military Coercion Against Taiwan"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_19_desc: "Swayed by external forces, the proxy authorities in Taiwan have escalated their defiance and rejected peaceful reunification, crossing our national red line. We will not sit idly by. The PLA will increase high-frequency encirclement drills with additional naval task forces and fighter sorties, underscoring the Party and the people’s unshakable resolve to complete national reunification. The aim is to instill fear in the proxy authorities and their patrons, sap their will to resist, and set conditions for decisive action."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_20: "Denounce Japanese–Australian Interference"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_20_desc: "We will publicize evidence of foreign collusion with “Taiwan independence,” mobilize our diplomatic network worldwide, and impose targeted countermeasures to deter interference."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_23_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_TW_LiuQiuExercise\n\n\n\n\nJapan has used America’s civil war as cover to reinforce its posture on Okinawa, gravely threatening stability in the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait and testing our bottom line. China will not look on passively. The PLA will stage large-scale joint air-sea drills in international waters near Okinawa, showcasing long-range strike capability and sending a clear signal to any schemer. This will meaningfully deter Japanese adventurism—or force a rethink of Tokyo’s support for the so-called “PDTO”—and help prevent further deterioration."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_24: "Issue a Red Travel Advisory for Taiwan"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_24_desc: "Given current conditions and the proxy regime’s behavior, we will issue a red travel alert via diplomatic channels, urge our citizens on the island to depart promptly, and facilitate Taiwan compatriots’ applications for mainland identification."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_25: "Neutralize Anti-China Media Personalities"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_25_desc: "A handful of media figures fan division and poison public sentiment with separatist propaganda, obstructing national reunification. We will arrest and expose principal offenders, publish their funding sources, and cut off their channels. Tearing away their mask serves justice, cleanses the discourse, and blunts the proxy regime’s information offensive—sweeping away invisible obstacles on the path to unification."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_26: "Denounce the Proxy Regime’s Treachery"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_26_desc: "The proxy authorities have colluded with the so-called “PDTO,” selling out national interests and rousing popular anger. We will set the record straight, publish the bill of particulars, and indict their betrayal—upholding national dignity, forging a broader consensus, and shrinking their remaining influence."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_27: "Plan a Landing on the Diaoyu Islands"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_27_desc: "The Diaoyu Islands are China’s inherent territory. For years they have been illegally occupied—abetted by the proxy regime’s craven sell-out. This tramples our sovereignty and is intolerable. The Marine Corps, together with the Navy and Air Force, will plan a swift landing to recover lost ground and shatter outside meddling."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_28: "Finalize the Taiwan War Plan"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_28_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_TW_WarPlanTW\n\n\n\n\nThe Taiwan campaign will be the PLA’s first modern war in a new era. We will activate and refine prior plans to win the fourth great campaign with meticulous preparation."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_29_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_TW_MobilizeRocketry\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Military Commission orders the Rocket Force to mass rapidly and, during the fire-preparation phase, execute surgical precision strikes against proxy military facilities and assembly areas—degrading defenses and shaping the battles to come."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_30: "Requisition Civilian Ports"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_30_desc: "To meet urgent operational needs, civilian ports along the southeast coast will be rapidly converted into wartime hubs—moving troops, stockpiling materiel, and tasking vessels. Civil capacity becomes military capability."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_31: "Expand Military Airfields"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_31_desc: "Facing a proxy that relies on outside backing, the PLA must seize air superiority with lightning speed. We will accelerate expansion of key airbases nationwide to support high-tempo fighter operations and dense UAV deployment."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_32: "Conduct Tri-Service Joint Exercises"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_32_desc: "Hopes for peace have collapsed. With the proxy camp running rampant, the PLA will begin its largest armed confrontation in more than three decades.

All for the liberation of Taiwan!"

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_34: "Publicize POW Leniency Policy"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_34_desc: "The proxy regime and its foreign patrons smear the PLA and sabotage our united-front efforts. We will not tolerate such slander. To win public support, we will reiterate and demonstrate our policy of humane treatment for prisoners—ensuring basic livelihood and dignity—produce documentary footage, and invite international observers."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_36: "Safeguard Livelihoods in Taiwan"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_36_desc: "War has strained livelihoods on the island; food and housing must be secured without delay. Guided by a people-first approach, we will rapidly allocate relief supplies to stabilize grain stocks and repair and assign housing—prioritizing the displaced. This will steady public sentiment, show national care, and hasten a return to normal life."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_37: "Cults and Gangs? Not One Left."
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_37_desc: "Enabled—or even encouraged—by the long-term negligence of the KMT and DPP, cults and criminal gangs have become a social blight in Taiwan. We will use firm measures to eradicate organized crime and purge cult ideology at speed, replacing it with the correct socialist core values and sound guidance for the public."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_38: "Compradors and Crony Capital? Confiscate It All."
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_38_desc: "Taiwan’s past economic achievements are undeniable, but capitalist compradors have long bled the people—laden with corruption and bribery. There is no leniency for such elements. Their assets will be confiscated and redirected to postwar reconstruction."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_39: "Order Restored—Rebuild at Scale"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_39_desc: "Thanks to the joint efforts of the Party Center, PLA garrison forces, the new Taiwan administration, patriots, and the people, wartime chaos has largely subsided. Organized resistance has been swept away. As the smoke clears, Taiwan stands ready to move forward with us."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_40: "Repair Essential Infrastructure"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_40_desc: "Despite strict adherence to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, the Taiwan campaign inevitably damaged infrastructure. Transport, power, and water systems demand urgent repair. We will mobilize engineering units and funding to restore critical services quickly—and improve them in the process."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_41: "Correct Misguided Historical–Cultural Narratives"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_41_desc: "Since taking office, the DPP has stoked “Taiwan independence,” seeking to split the country and earning infamy. Though halted, their distortions misled many. We will conduct a comprehensive rectification in culture and history: Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_42: "Support Advanced-Thinking Local Representatives"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_42_desc: "Years of DPP agitation have eroded trust in centrally appointed officials; that won’t change overnight. We will therefore support locally rooted, forward-thinking representatives who enjoy public confidence. As the full administrative framework takes shape, they will hold key posts within it."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_43: "Invest in Taiwan’s Factories"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_43_desc: "In line with our real-economy-first approach, we will invest in plants and enterprises on the island, help them resume production, and integrate them into the national economy."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_44: "One Family on Both Sides of the Strait"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_44_desc: "Whatever the proxy authorities once claimed, people on both sides of the Strait are kin separated for over seventy years. With stability restored, we will formally end military administration and incorporate the Taiwan Autonomous Region into normal governance—allowing free travel across the Strait. Our blood ties cannot be cut."

  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_45: "Reconstruction Complete—Establish Taiwan Province"
  TFR_PRC_TW_GUI_D_45_desc: "Through tireless work by people on both sides and the PLA, infrastructure is fully restored and daily life back on track. With the creation of Taiwan Province, the people of Taiwan formally return to the national family."

  ## idea
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_1: "§RRaving Madness§!"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_1_desc: "Perhaps years of brainwashing by the Green camp and Japan have finally borne fruit: many on the island now truly believe that, with Japanese backing, they can not only repel the mainland but even counterattack and seize China’s southeast coast. No one abroad thinks this fever dream is possible, yet they tirelessly chant independence slogans at every turn. Maybe this is what they mean by: without madness, no life."

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_2: "Pro-Japan Concord"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_2_desc: "Under relentless pressure, Japan has engineered the information cocoon it wanted. The island’s public is flooded with anti-China, pro-Japan propaganda; reasonable voices can no longer shape opinion. On the island today, “imperial collaborationists” are far from rare."

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_3: "Boiling Over"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_3_desc: "Anger on the island is at a boil. Many believe the Communists ignore their views and even their lives. The Green camp—and Japan and others—are stoking and steering that fury, hardening it into a new force bent on independence by arms."

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_4: "Wishful Thinking Persists"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_4_desc: "Clear-eyed people in Taiwan know unification is only a matter of time. But ambitious schemers and quislings have woven a net of opinion that blankets the island, so many still think American support can sustain long partition—or even a counterattack on the mainland. As China’s strength surges, that manufactured mirage is one step from shattering…"

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_5: "Frowns and Doubt"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_5_desc: "Mainland policies have not won over the island’s public; many feel ignored by Beijing and the Party. Old KMT misdeeds come to mind and are projected onto today’s events. Fueled by media hype and Japan’s narrative offensive, this low, steady dislike will pose problems if force must be used."

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_6: "No Friendly Eyes"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_6_desc: "To many islanders, the CCP and the DPP look the same—only a question of which hand does the squeezing. That attitude suits the Green camp and Japan just fine, boxing the populace out of our united-front work."

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_7: "Harmony Above All"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_7_desc: "Peace is precious—even if the Green camp sees it differently. A series of mainland moves has shown many in Taiwan that Beijing does not seek to wreck stability. On that premise, doubts about the DPP are rising; its plan to seize independence by force looks like a betrayal of the people. Their spin machine is losing its grip…"

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_8: "Hearts Seek Stability"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_8_desc: "Island residents see ever more clearly who is friend and who is foe. The DPP’s behavior approaches open predation, while the mainland has acted measured and conciliatory. Trust in Taiwan- and Japan-based media is ebbing; calls for peaceful reunification are swelling…"

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_9: "Bound by Blood"
  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_9_desc: "Two shores, one people—brothers of the same nation, members of the same family. This line from the PRC Foreign Ministry has become a mainstream consensus on the island. Barring a small minority, most now pin their hopes on peaceful reunification. Exiles and sojourners yearn to return to the motherland’s embrace…"

  PRC_tw_gui_PEACE_10_desc: "Spirits are high, resolve is fierce. The island is aflame with anticipation—for imminent reunification, for a brighter future, for the rise of the Chinese nation. Anti-Japan, anti-separatist marches are breaking out everywhere; support for unification has peaked. No one can dampen this zeal now—not even the people themselves…"

Streams of information were being fused, units were redeployed, sorties assigned—China was throwing its full weight behind preparations for a fateful war. Deep beneath the headquarters, a meeting was underway.\n\n\"Our initial preparations against the island will be led by the Rocket Force, with 300–370 mm long-range rocket artillery in support, executed in three waves. We will in turn paralyze the puppet forces’ air and naval power and their bases, destroy their administrative organs and key power and water infrastructure. After these three waves, we will have seized full dominance in the electromagnetic spectrum, in the air, and at sea over the Strait,\" reported Eastern Theater Commander Lin Xiangyang. On the rostrum, General Zhang Youxia nodded his approval.\n\n\"Thereafter, our Army will put the Marine Corps forward as the vanguard. Under naval and air fires, we will land at Taiwan’s ports and beachheads; simultaneously, our Airborne troops will seize Taoyuan Airport to cut off every escape route for the leaders of the Taiwan-independence clique. Once the initial lodgments are secure, follow-on echelons will surge ashore. We estimate that outside Taipei and a few other major cities, fighting on the island will end rapidly,\" said General He Weidong, as the on-screen order of battle for the landing force appeared. The PLA’s ground forces had awaited this moment for a long time.\n\n\"In the air domain, our aviation units will launch from coastal bases to maintain absolute air superiority over the Strait, while conducting 24/7 surveillance and strikes on all high-threat targets on the island. We will also watch closely for potential Japanese and South Korean interference from the East China Sea,\" said Air Force Commander Chang Dingqiu.\n\n\"The Navy is at a high state of alert; the amphibious convoys are ready. We will enforce the blockade of Taiwan and stand ready for area denial—destroying any Japanese or Australian surface vessels that attempt to support the theater,\" said Navy Commander Dong Jun, pointing to the real-time display of PLA Navy movements. He had full confidence in his sailors and marines.\n\n\"Comrades!\" General Zhang Youxia rose; the assembled commanders stood with him.\n\n\"In this campaign to take Taiwan, we have both the strength and the resolve. We will bring to bear overwhelming firepower and bury every reactionary who blocks the cause of reunification. I believe…\"\n\nZhang paused, then continued:"

  twgui.1000.t: "Final Episode of “Across the Strait”"
  twgui.1000.d: "Recently, Japan’s naked ambition to interfere in China’s internal affairs has been laid bare; its reactionary government keeps pontificating on the Taiwan question. Meanwhile, the authorities on the island have been busy with their own petty maneuvers.\n\nJapan’s foreign minister has declared that Japan will uphold Asia’s so-called “rules-based order,” even claiming leadership among Asia’s “democracies,” and will resolutely block “certain revisionist states from altering the world order in violation of international law.”\n\nTaiwan’s military, for its part, has announced plans to spend on the order of €10 billion on arms from Japan to curry favor with Tokyo. Why does the island care so much about Japan’s attitude? And what will this mean for cross-strait relations?\nTo explore these questions, the producers of “Across the Strait” invited Professor Li of the Beijing Institute for Cross-Strait Relations, Professor Qian of Fudan University’s Taiwan Studies Center in Shanghai, and Professor You of Taiwan’s Shih Hsin University. The three scholars discussed the state of cross-strait affairs.\n\nProfessor Li opened: “The island’s decision to lavish funds on Japanese military equipment is, at bottom, an attempt by ‘Taiwan independence’ forces to find an external patron. For years, Japan has played an ignoble role on the Taiwan question, encouraging some ‘Taiwan independence’ elements—desperate to oppose the mainland—to clutch at straws and collude with Tokyo.”\n\nProfessor Qian added: “The island’s fixation on Japan is largely the product of deliberate misdirection by ‘Taiwan independence’ forces. They try to project the false signal that Japanese backing will enable them to push separatism. In reality, this accomplishes nothing and gravely harms cross-strait relations. It damages national feeling on both sides—many in Taiwan know full well Japan is no reliable ally—and it challenges the mainland’s bottom line on Taiwan. The mainland will not sit idly by.”\n\nProfessor You concluded: “This toadying to Japan contributes nothing positive to cross-strait ties; it only heightens tensions. If left unchecked, peace and stability in the Strait will be in extreme danger. To restore healthy development, these malign external links must be severed.”\n\nAfter the discussion, the host posed a question on behalf of the audience: “In today’s complex international environment, how should we balance cross-strait relations with external relations?”\n\nProfessor Li replied: “We must uphold the one-China principle and firmly oppose any external interference in China’s internal affairs. At the same time, we should advance dialogue and exchanges to deepen mutual understanding and trust among compatriots on both sides, promoting peaceful development of cross-strait relations together.”\n\n“As for ordinary people in Taiwan, how can they better grasp the substance of cross-strait relations?”\n\nProfessor Qian answered: “We need to strengthen cultural exchange and education across the Strait, so more people in Taiwan can understand the mainland’s development and progress, and recognize that both sides belong to one Chinese nation. Only by increasing mutual understanding and respect can we achieve long-term stability and development in cross-strait relations.”"

  twgui.1001.d: "Following the great historic achievement of national reunification, the team behind the widely watched “Across the Strait” announced that the program will be renamed “One Family Across the Strait” and will relaunch.\n\nThe show will debut with a renewed look, a refreshed guest format, and new editorial choices. As a key window showcasing the brilliant results of cross-strait integration—comprehensively and in depth—it will shine like a bright pearl on the stage of cross-strait cooperation.\n\nGuest selection will no longer be limited to the previous scholar-heavy format focused on exchanges and commentary. As cross-strait relations advance under the framework of national reunification, “One Family Across the Strait” will invite more guests who have made outstanding contributions to economic integration.\n\nGuests will come from all sectors on both sides of the Strait. There will be entrepreneurs who, despite many hardships, stayed true to integrity, opened new markets, and enabled the exchange of distinctive products—adjusting their strategies step by step, finding their footing, and helping to drive flourishing cross-strait trade.\nThere will be ambassadors of culture who devote themselves to preserving and passing on Chinese traditions—tirelessly traveling between the two shores to organize cultural events, from safeguarding folk crafts to sharing classical poetry—bringing the treasures of Chinese civilization back into public view and renewing a sense of shared roots and heritage.\nIn science and technology, many unsung researchers deserve attention. They tackle tough problems, build cross-border partnerships, and take on frontier topics that shape humanity’s future. Their intelligence and sweat propel cross-strait innovation and demonstrate a joint determination to climb the heights of advanced technology.\n\nThe program’s transformation enriches its content and suits the needs of the times. It allows viewers to see the full landscape of integration and to understand that cross-strait relations now permeate every facet of life—integrated development is an irresistible tide of history.\n\nThis program will surely leave a vivid, weighty page in the ongoing story of cross-strait relations, deepening understanding and cooperation as both sides move toward a better future."

  twgui.1002.t: "Lightning and Thunder"
  twgui.1002.d: "Since the Eastern Theater went to Level-One combat readiness, the PLA Navy has rapidly shifted to a wartime posture and completed a comprehensive blockade of Taiwan; Army and People’s Armed Police units have secured full-area control; and the Information Support Force has finished exhaustive, precise confirmation of the situation on the island and in surrounding seas. The preparatory phase is complete. All joint combat units in the Eastern Theater are at the highest state of readiness and can execute orders at any moment.\n\nBefore launching the full-scale offensive, one final task remains: to reduce pressure on our brothers in the landing force by destroying fortifications the puppet authorities might use for last-ditch resistance, thereby minimizing casualties. In accordance with the core operational concept of the information–fires integration doctrine, the Eastern Theater’s Rocket Force will conduct a round of precise, long-range strikes before the formal outbreak of hostilities.\n\nIn the cold just before dawn, missile transporter-erector-launchers rolled into their firing positions. After intense checks and tests by the crews, missiles completed self-tests, were erected, ran simulated launches, and returned to their hides. When the order to fire is given, a storm of arrows loosed from the string will punch through the clouds, crossing the Strait and falling like bolts of lightning from the overcast. The puppet regime’s critical military facilities and defensive positions will be smashed by the punishment of heaven the Republic delivers. And when the thunder has passed, the reactionaries entrenched on Taiwan will meet their true judgment day."

  twgui.1003.t: "The Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee Convenes"
  twgui.1003.d: "In November 2021, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (the 19th Sixth Plenum) convened in Beijing. The meeting conducted summary discussions on three major issues—the COVID crisis, the oil crisis, and power-sector reform—concluding that all three should occupy an important place in the Party’s centennial struggle. It also reviewed and adopted the “Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party’s Centennial Struggle.” Summarizing the Party’s historic achievements and experience was deemed necessary to launch the new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects under the conditions of the Party’s centennial; to strengthen the Four Consciousnesses, bolster confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture, resolutely uphold Comrade Xi Jinping’s core position on the Central Committee and in the whole Party, uphold the Central Committee’s authority and centralized, unified leadership, and ensure the whole Party advances in step; and to advance the Party’s self-revolution, raise the whole Party’s ability to struggle and handle risks, keep the Party full of vitality, and unite the people of all ethnic groups in continuing the fight for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation—the Chinese Dream.\n\nThe whole Party was called upon to uphold historical materialism and a correct view of Party history: to see clearly why we succeeded in the past, to understand how we can continue to succeed in the future, and thus to practice our original mission with greater conviction—better upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. The Plenum emphasized the decisive significance of the “Two Establishes,” laying the ideological groundwork for the 20th National Congress. It called on the Party to learn from history to open up the future, unite and lead the people toward the Second Centenary Goal, remember the lessons and mission of the Liberation War, and be ready for all contingencies. Of note, the Resolution reiterated the stance of never renouncing the use of force to achieve reunification with Taiwan, sparking vigorous debate at home and abroad.\n\nWhat was not disclosed publicly: at the end of the meeting, members engaged in deep discussion and rigorous argumentation, concluding that under current international conditions the previous line—prioritizing the quest for peaceful reunification—should be set aside in favor of more proactive measures. It was decided that, at an appropriate time, the Liberation War would be reactivated and force would be used directly to achieve reunification and complete China’s great cause.\n\nThe mobilization drafts submitted by the Central Military Commission were approved. After decades of relative silence, China’s vast war machine would roar once more."

  twgui.1004.t: "A Party Branch Study Session"
  twgui.1004.d: "After every major Party meeting that makes major decisions, local Party branches hold study sessions—this is routine. When the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee adjourned a few days ago and issued its historic Resolution, Wang Yaojie knew a full-branch study marathon was inevitable. Fair enough: at over 36,000 characters, few would read it without an organized session. Not that it concerned him—he had already read the full text the day it was released, and his study report sat atop a stack of documents, ready to hand in after he caught a nap at the meeting and then enjoyed his time off. He had even pre-done the task the secretary would surely assign: print hard copies of the Resolution for everyone. The reams he’d run off early were right now tucked under his report.\n\nBefore long, Secretary Liu arrived.\n\n“Yaojie, print the Resolution from the Sixth Plenum for tomorrow’s study session. Forty pages per set, and print a lot of sets. Special paper is on the way—if you need more, report to me. The file’s on this USB stick. Make sure you do the printing yourself. When you’re done, hand them directly to me—no more and no fewer than the exact number of pages. Understood?”\n\nWang was struck by Liu’s unprecedented seriousness, but he still took the USB. One thing nagged him: his advance printout had been thirty-seven pages. Where had the extra three come from?\n\nHe set aside his doubts, went to collect the sealed printer paper—and then it hit him. The extra three pages had to be something big, something not to be leaked. When those neat Song-type characters swam into view, he felt a jolt run through him from head to toe. Compared with this, a wasted study report was the least of it."

  twgui.1005.d: "At 8:00 a.m. Beijing time, in light of the current international situation and realities, the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, exercising its powers under Article 62, Paragraph 15 of the Constitution of the PRC, convened an emergency plenary session and deliberated and adopted the “Decision on Taking All Necessary Measures to Safeguard National Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity.” The meeting pointed out that, given decades of repeated provocations by the rebel authorities on Taiwan and their reactionary rule on the island, together with their intolerable refusal to return peacefully to the motherland, the NPC, by unanimous vote of all deputies, authorized the People’s Republic of China to take measures for reunification by force in the near future. At the same time, the meeting voted on measures to deal with attempts by Japan, Australia, and others to meddle in China’s internal affairs. It was unanimously decided that should Japan, Australia, or any such countries persist in interference and stubbornly support the puppet authorities’ last-ditch resistance, China will impose a range of wartime measures—including but not limited to blockade and embargo—against them and their allied states.\n\nIn addition, the NPC discussed and voted on a series of important matters concerning the economy and people’s livelihood. But everyone present knew where the true gravity lay. Reports on the important political, economic, legal, and social items passed at this session have already spread among the public and sparked broad discussion. The most consequential item, however—the first time since the NPC’s establishment in 1954 that it has proactively voted to authorize the Central Military Commission of the PRC to undertake acts of war—will be publicized and unsealed at an appropriate time. That will be the moment when…"

  twgui.1006.d: "With the last pockets of die-hard separatists and foreign interventionist troops choosing to lay down arms before the irresistible tide, the Chinese nation has at last achieved long-awaited reunification. During the Battle of Taipei, the principal ringleaders of “Taiwan independence”—Tsai Ing-wen, Su Tseng-chang, Lai Ching-te, and others—were rounded up in one sweep by PLA air-assault forces. They will now face the judgment long awaited by 1.4 billion Chinese people.\n\nGeneral Secretary Xi Jinping has announced the formal end of the Liberation War. Reconstruction in Taiwan is in full swing: mainland firms are vying for contracts, and the central authorities have unveiled major projects to integrate Taiwan’s economy with the mainland. Volunteer reconstruction teams organized by local governments across the country are arriving to help with postwar recovery. The PLA will assess incidental losses to the property of compatriots on the island caused by the fighting and provide appropriate compensation.\n\nTaiwan will remain under military administration for a period, with phased lifting as reconstruction milestones are met. Full integration of Taiwan with the mainland is only a matter of time. Nearly all Chinese take profound satisfaction in the end of seventy-five years of division. Across the land, organizations large and small hold events celebrating reunification; from six-year-olds to octogenarians, people are immersed in the joy of national unity. For the Chinese people at large, the shame of a sundered motherland is at last washed away."

  twgui.1007.t: "A Gentle Rain Washes Old Dust"
  twgui.1007.d: "Fine rain, like strands of silk, fell over a secluded vale in the hills near Taipei. The head of the Ministry of State Security’s Special Taiwan Group stood before a memorial, face grave, posture straight as a pine. Behind him, dozens of plainclothes officers formed two neat ranks, standing at attention like sentries guarding a charge.\n\nHe took a white chrysanthemum from an aide. Snow-white petals; a bead of dew on the stem, clear as crystal—one droplet slid down and landed on the callus at the base of his trigger finger. The young officers passed bouquets down the line, movements steady and solemn—handing along conviction and respect. Tears welled in the leader’s eyes and mingled with the rain, spattering on the blue-stone flags. He drew out a piece of velvet and wiped the base of the statue; the rain-soaked granite shone more brightly, as though nature herself were brushing off the dust.\n\nHe produced a timeworn cup, poured out half a measure of aged liquor at the bronze figure’s feet. The amber seeped into the earth, its fragrance rising—a libation of memory and honor. As the last of it sank away, a shaft of sunlight slipped through the clouds like a golden thread, piercing the gloom and touching the hollow. Sensing his lashes tremble and his back bow forward, the young officers paid their respects to those who came before. That ray of light was a comfort across time; in that moment, history and the present met. The young had not lived through blood and fire, but from their leader’s bearing they understood the mission and the burden—etched into the bone: duty and loyalty.\n\n“Our predecessors used their lives to pave our road. We must not let their sacrifice be in vain.” His low voice rang like a bell in their hearts. Their eyes were steady as stars, lighting the path ahead; no more words were needed—their resolve had already been spoken in their gaze.\n\nThe rain tapered off. In the vale, a distinct scent spread—the heaviness of earth mingled with the fragrance of plants and the freshness of the air. Overhead, a warm beam of light pushed stubbornly through the layered clouds, opening a clear patch of sky. That gilded glow lay gently upon the sculpture, sheathing the spirits of the fallen in an eternal radiance.\n\nThey turned as one and set off with measured steps. They knew: this was the end of one inheritance—and the first page of a new charge."

  twgui.1008.d: "“Mainland aircraft at six thousand meters in the southwest sector of Taiwan airspace, attention…” In an aging F-16A/B stamped with the white sun roundel, Captain Lin Wei was once again flying a routine intercept to “drive off” PLA aircraft. A design dating back to the 1980s felt feeble against the mainland’s air power; the engine’s roar couldn’t drown out his inner turmoil.\n\nHe had once taken pride in defending his home. Now he felt only confusion. Since Tsai Ing-wen sold out to the Japanese and hitched Taiwan to Australia in the so-called Pacific Defense Treaty, the other side’s exercises had become ever more frequent. Facing the PLA’s depth of manpower and strength, front-line pilots like him could only ramp up scramble counts on orders from above to paper over their shortcomings—dragging everyone on base into the grinder.\n\n“Hell—if Tsai Ing-wen is so scared of the PLA, why doesn’t she come fly the damned plane herself…”\n\nGrumbling, Lin went through the motions on the open channel with the J-16 alongside: “You have entered my airspace and are affecting flight safety. Turn away and leave immediately…”\n\nThe reply was calm and firm: “This is Chinese airspace. I am on combat air patrol here. You have no authority to interfere.”\n\nLin thought of his family down in Kaohsiung, of the exhausted young soldiers on base. The PLA’s pressure was everywhere; the taskings only grew; morale was collapsing. More and more people whispered: Why die for Tsai Ing-wen’s puppet regime? The compatriots across the Strait are not the enemy—perhaps reunification is the way out. When the J-16 on the far side finished its patrol and departed, Lin exhaled—another day without a shooting war.\n\nHe knew this standoff only bought time. The PLA’s strength was beyond doubt; America had other fires to fight; the “PDT” promises were just ink on paper.\n\nBack at base, he filed his report in silence, carrying a thought no one knew. He was not alone—the murmurs among his comrades betrayed the same fatigue and the same longing: for peace, for an end to bloodshed, for a return to the motherland.\n\nThe setting sun reddened the water. Lin stared across the Strait and made up his mind: if the situation changed again, he would not fight for division. Better to meet a unified future than to vanish in a hopeless resistance.\n\nFor now, he still had to launch for the next sortie—but his heart had already flown to the far shore."

Their task: when a Chinese KJ-500 AEW aircraft approached the edge of an exercise area, slip past the radar screen and execute a surprise “drive-off.” Confident in the F-35’s stealth, she regarded the mission as a mere warm-up.\n\nThe pair entered per plan; the Chinese KJ-500 and its escorts were clear on radar—everything seemed under control. Takatsukasa adjusted her helmet display and scanned the sky via the Distributed Aperture System, ready to issue a warning on the open channel. The corners of her mouth lifted as she pictured the Chinese pilot panicking at her call. She couldn’t help a flicker of pride.\n\nAt the moment she keyed the mic, two fast-closing contacts appeared on the radar from her rear quarter, both above Mach 0.9. She froze, then her eyes flew wide: “Chink planes? Impossible!” She flipped to IRST and confirmed it wasn’t a ghost—two J-20s were already close.\n\nA cool, authoritative female voice came over the open channel in unruffled Chinese: “Calling Japanese aircraft. You have entered our exercise area. Leave immediately, or we will take necessary measures.” Takatsukasa glanced left. A J-20 sat off her wing, the low-viz Bayi roundel glinting in the sun. Her pulse raced. “What are those clowns on the E-767 doing?” she muttered.\n\nUnwilling to back down, she yanked the stick. Pulling 7 Gs, the F-35 carved a tight arc to shake the tail. No matter how she maneuvered, the J-20s stayed welded to her and her wingman. She even tried high-alpha tricks using thrust vectoring, but the J-20s—thanks to superior aerodynamics and thrust-to-weight—followed with air-show ease, their agility and persistence beyond anything she had imagined.\n\nThe Chinese pilot keyed up again, voice still calm and professional: “Japanese aircraft, leave the exercise area now. We do not wish to trigger an unnecessary incident.”\n\nGrinding her teeth, Takatsukasa snapped back, “This is international airspace. You have no right to interfere with our flight!” The reply was crisp and final: “The exercise area was published in advance via Notice to Airmen. Please respect our sovereignty and safety.”\n\n“Damn it! This can’t be happening!” Sweat beaded on her brow—disbelief giving way to frustration.\n\nAt last the two J-20s surged ahead, slid neatly across her nose, and began dispensing flares—an incandescent curtain of fire.\n\nShe finally accepted the futility of further struggle. With her wingman, she withdrew from the exercise box under the J-20s’ escort. As the Chinese fighters peeled away, she thought she heard one pilot chuckle in a language she didn’t understand:"

The Chinese government expresses its strong indignation and resolute opposition.\n\nTaiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. Achieving national reunification is the common aspiration of all Chinese people, and no external force has any right to interfere in China’s internal affairs.\n\nBy hyping the notion of “Asia-Pacific defense,” meddling in the Taiwan question, and seeking to use military and political means to hinder China’s great cause of reunification, Japan and Australia are committing a grave infringement on China’s sovereignty and a blatant violation of the basic norms governing international relations. Under the UN Charter and international law, sovereign states have the right to safeguard territorial integrity and national unity. The actions of Japan and Australia violate the principle of non-interference and run counter to the broad consensus of the international community.\n\nWe urge the Japanese and Australian governments to cease their interference in the Taiwan question and to respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Early the following year, China acted decisively: forces landed on Taiwan and completed the great cause of national reunification. Amid this sweeping turn of history, former “national army” Captain Chen Weiguo chose to stand with his motherland.\n\nEven while in service, Chen had long yearned for the mainland. On his private phone he chatted with mainland netizens over QQ; the group’s name, “Wangzhai,” wordlessly expressed his discontent with Taiwan’s status quo and his desire for unification.\n\nChen dreamed of the mainland’s magnificent rivers and mountains—his own homeland, which he had never seen with his own eyes.\n\nAs America’s civil war intensified, the puppet authorities in Taiwan, defying the irresistible tide of reunification, sold themselves to the “Pacific Defense Treaty” led by Japan, gambling that support from Japan, Australia, and New Zealand could halt unification. Though Chen served in the Air Force Weather Wing and not at the front, he could see clearly that the pseudo-government was driving Taiwan toward the abyss. They began arresting anyone with ties to the mainland, especially holders of the Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents. The atmosphere grew ever more tense. By caution and luck, Chen avoided the dragnet.\n\nOn the day of the landing, Chen held his tongue no longer. He led several conscientious comrades in a mutiny, seized the weather station, and surrendered to the advancing PLA. In that moment, he felt a release he had never known—he was finally standing on the right side of history.\n\nWhen the fighting ended and the dust settled, Chen received his new ID card from the motherland and bid the past goodbye. Without hesitation, he set out on the journey he had dreamed of for years. His destination was Xinjiang—the vast land he had heard mainland friends describe so many times in that chat group. Stepping out of the station, he lifted his face into the brilliant sun and drew a deep breath of the crisp air. He felt it then—a sense of belonging: this was his country, his home.\n\nA new beginning, starting in Xinjiang.\n\nFrom here he planned to roam the breadth of the motherland: to see the sea of clouds over Huangshan, the Great Wall’s grandeur, the galloping herds on the steppe—and to meet, one by one, the friends scattered across China whom he had known only online. As “Wangzhai,” he had joined them in talking late into the night about the day of reunification. Now he would turn those lines of text into real embraces.\n\nStanding on Xinjiang’s soil, Chen’s heart was at peace. He had shed his old shackles and stepped into a new life. Sunlight warmed his back; he looked to the distance filled with expectation. This land—broad and generous—carried his dreams, and the hopes of countless compatriots."

Since the recovery of Taiwan, telecom-fraud cases had poured in without pause; even running at full tilt, his team could barely keep up.\n\n“Chief, we’ve even printed anti-scam warnings on eggs—how are so many people still getting cheated?” Officer Xiao Zhang had just returned from a victim’s home—an eighty-something grandmother whose pension had been swindled—and the bitterness showed in his voice.\n\n“These animals,” Li slammed a fist on the desk. “Kidnapping, drug dealing, pimping, telecom fraud, trafficking in people and even organs—these former members of the old regime’s ‘cyber warfare unit’ are just back to their true trade. Plenty of this before reunification, too.” Red veins laced his eyes. “Damn it—if I have to turn Taiwan upside-down to find this king-rat, I will.” He glared at the wall-sized board of leads and strings.\n\nSuddenly Technician Xiao Gao ran in. “Chief! Good news—the suspect’s IP is fully pinned down.”\n\n“Good!” Li straightened his tunic and cap. “All units—move out!”"

  twgui.1014.t: "An Old Soldier Sets Foot on Taiwan"
  twgui.1014.d: "Chen Fusheng, born in Longyan, Fujian, had reached seventy. His hair had gone white, but his back was still straight. When the Zhenbao Island incident broke out in 1969 he was fifteen; he hadn’t fought in that northern clash, but the radio at home set his blood on fire. Later, he enlisted behind his parents’ backs, determined to defend the homeland. He never made it to the northern front, but he did reach another: posted to Fuzhou. He watched the Strait, stood his posts, and listened to the surf for three years before demobilizing and returning to Longyan.\n\nAs a boy, he often heard his mother murmur by lamplight, “In my lifetime, I want to see Taiwan come home.” Her words took root. Even after he left the service, he kept watch on the far shore of the Strait in his heart.\n\nNow, wearing his old uniform, he stood on the quay at Keelung—the first time he had set foot on this land. The sea breeze brought that familiar briny tang. He slowly knelt and pressed his palm to the ground. “Ma,” he whispered, “what you never lived to see—I have seen for you.”\n\nThe docks bustled around him: new cranes swung cargo ashore; young soldiers worked seamlessly with local stevedores; far towers glittered, brighter than anything his old political instructor had ever described. He heard locals talking in Minnan—a bit different from his village accent, but still home to the ear. Fujian and the Treasure Island had always shared the same blood.\n\nLingering at a street corner, he watched compatriots on both sides of the Strait stand together again. His eyes burned. “Ma,” he said softly, “you hoped for this your whole life. I’ve finally seen the age of reunification for you.”"

  twgui.1015.t: "The Old Engineer’s Second Trip to Taipei"
  twgui.1015.d: "Ke Xixian stepped once more onto Fisherman’s Wharf. It was his second time in Taiwan, fourteen years after he had last come to visit relatives. The factory’s former chief engineer—newly retired back then—was now white-haired but hale, though his notebook-hand now showed a scatter of age spots.\n\nAcross his eighty-plus years, this island across the Strait had been the knot he could never quite untie. When he was young and the workshops were still in ruins, he had led militia patrols up and down the river levees through the night, wary of frogmen from the far shore coming to sabotage the machines. After retirement he learned that the kid “taken away” from the factory back in the day had made a life in Taiwan.\n\nThat first visit hadn’t left him with a good impression. The boy who once toddled after him begging for candy had gray at his temples; his grand-nephew, though, gave the old man a bitter moment—pointing at a pack of chewing gum and asking, “Third-Grandpa, does China have this?” The usually imperturbable elder went home, handed his copper-tipped belt to his grandson, and told him, “After liberation, go over there and give your cousin a good thrashing.”\n\nNow, seeing his kid brother in the distance waving as hard as he could, the old engineer shrugged off helping hands and strode toward him. He glanced at the young man with a cane and worried face—no longer a child, but a new generation in full.\n\nSmiling, he tossed his yellowed notebook to the grandson shouldering a backpack and a rolling case. The boy fumbled to catch it. The old man had kept that notebook since he was young—sixty years, and still trim and neat; you could tell how he cherished it.\n\nA slip of paper slid free. The ink looked fresh—probably written last night. The calligraphy was strong and steady."

  twgui.1016.d: "At two in the afternoon, Second Lieutenant Lü led his platoon down a grimy Taipei street. From behind the windows on both sides he could feel eyes—fearful, curious—watching them pass.\n\n“People here have had it rough. Small shopkeepers pay protection to gangs, and kids get dragged off the straight path—skipping school to run wild. Grow up with no skills and they end up as thugs.”\n\nThe speaker was Officer Chen, their local liaison. They were moving toward a neighborhood the gang had occupied. The outfit had repeatedly harassed and threatened community workers—and now had the gall to spark open riots.\n\n“The old society turned people into ghosts. Now we’re here to turn ghosts back into people.” Lieutenant Lü’s tread was firm, his stride confident—like the Republic under his boots, pressing forward without pause.\n\nThe gang had scraped up every usable body to hold the intersection. The mob was a jumble of pickpockets, junkies, bikers, and scammers, plus a crowd of young hotheads they had riled up. They hurled filth and gestures at the Armed Police and laughed off Lü’s call to lay down arms.\n\nDrilled to a hair, the PAP troopers advanced slowly under a screen of tear gas, a single moving wall. The gang, juiced on adrenaline, rushed in. In under ten minutes of close-quarters scuffle, the line broke—the toughs cracked.\n\n“Run!” someone screamed. Weapons clattered to the pavement as the mob wheeled and stampeded, shouldering and trampling one another—little brothers bowling over big brothers. A few turned to swing back and were dropped with a single baton and cuffed. They tried every alley, every lane, and found each one blocked by waiting squads. At last they realized there was nowhere left to run.\n\nFrom the windows, those watching saw the swaggerers who had terrorized them lying on the ground crying for their mothers. “Squat,” said the troopers, and they squatted; “move,” and they moved—no one dared an extra twitch.\n\nThe same scene played out across the island. Overnight, the tangled roots of the underworld were ripped up. News bulletins rolled out the sentences for the worst of them. As for the younger ones whose crimes were lighter, they would learn trades in juvenile reform, remaking themselves through work."

The Eastern Fleet would answer with thunder. Three maritime red lines had been drawn—an inviolate moat.\n\nThe carrier strike group pushed out into the Pacific east of Taiwan; its air wing swept the broad seas, leaving no hiding place for Japanese or Australian transports. The First Interception Group completed its ready posture off Taipei, solid as a fortress; the Second Interception Group stood to off Kaohsiung, coiled to strike.\n\nThe Strait itself was the Air Force’s arena; the Republic’s war-eagles would not fail the Motherland.\n\nThen the northern sea began to stir. Off Taipei, a set of moving blips appeared on the command screen—heading straight for the First Group’s barrier.\n\nIntelligence reported three Japanese fast transports disguised as civilian vessels, trying to slip through the northern line under cover of night.\n\n“Hnh. They really picked the northern route.” Wang’s voice was flint. “First Group, intercept. Call in Air Force support!” The First Group surged. Frigates’ turbines howled as they formed the wall. Radar painted the targets; guns stood ready. On the open maritime channel, a stern warning rang out: “Vessels ahead, attention: this is the Chinese Navy. You are about to enter a no-sail zone for exercises off the Taiwan Province of the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe targets held course—trying to ram the gate. Under the commander’s hand, the ships brought laser-dazzler suppression to bear.\n\nAt the critical instant, J-16s stooped like hunting falcons. “Targets locked,” the pilots reported.\n\nSo much for luck. Faced with massed sea-and-air force, panicked voices chattered over the airwaves, reporting they were locked up. The three transports swung about in disorder and fled the cordon.\n\nWatching the enemy pips recede, the admiral knew this was only the beginning. But anything that tested the red lines of the Republic would be dashed to pieces by its sea and air power.\n\nThe northern line fell quiet again, leaving only the wakes of the fleet and the silhouettes of circling eagles."

Execution Summary\nUnits of the Eastern Theater Rocket Force strictly implemented the operational plan and successfully carried out the theater-wide strategic coercion joint action codenamed “Silent Dawn.” Guided by the principles of “precision strikes, system paralysis, vital-node destruction, and integrated deterrence-cum-combat,” the operation advanced precisely, efficiently, and in good order along the preset campaign timeline. All core campaign objectives met their prescribed damage indices. We hereby submit a summary of the battlespace situation and an initial effects assessment.\n\nII. Battlespace Key Points\n(1) Island-chain air defense network collapsed\nAcross the island—including fixed long-range early-warning radars and major ground listening stations in the western heartland, Keelung in the north, Hengchun in the south, and Hualien in the east—targets were rendered inoperative or permanently destroyed by multiple waves of precision fires. Follow-on assessment and reconnaissance indicate the enemy’s mobile short-/medium-range air-defense systems suffered widespread self-induced failures; the integrated air-defense network has lost effective control.\n(2) War potential degraded\nThrough saturation attacks, power plants, substations, critical valve complexes, and strategic fuel depots were destroyed, with no prospect of near-term repair. Key interchanges, tunnels, and bridges on the ring expressway were struck with precision; most are blocked, with only a few passable at low speed. Owing to traffic interdiction and fuel shortages, heavy forces now possess virtually zero strategic/operational mobility. Against the underground strategic reserve complex, special penetrator munitions achieved through-burrow effects; multiple cavern depots sympathetically detonated, with seismic signatures captured by geologic monitoring systems.\n(3) Strategic naval nodes sunk into paralysis\nAt major naval bases, core facilities were heavily damaged and main channels sealed. Intercepted encrypted reports show ships without power, berths destroyed, and large surface combatants and submarines stripped of home-port support—unable to replenish, repair, or sortie again.\n\nIII. Conclusion\nThis Rocket Force action achieved its strategic coercion purpose and has established overwhelming conditions for subsequent joint operations. The Theater will continue to monitor residual enemy activity, maintain strong deterrence, and stands ready to launch decisive actions on order.\n\nSubmitted by the Eastern Theater Rocket Force."

  twgui.1020.d: "The sun rose in the east; morning light broke through the clouds and poured across the earth.\n\nAs the day’s first brilliance washed the city, a convoy of black Hongqi sedans, bracketed by ZBL-08 armored vehicles and “Mengshi” transports, sped through Taipei’s streets. In minutes they reached their destination—the National Palace Museum, Taipei.\n\nAs the convoy rolled up, the gate guards swung the doors wide. The lead Mengshi guided the Hongqi limousines inside; the ZBL-08s held at the entrance. PLA soldiers dismounted, hefting large slatted crates in formation toward the museum’s main doors.\n\nOn the main steps stood Deputy Director Yu Peijin and Executive Deputy Director Huang Yongtai, pacing as they waited. The moment the vehicles stopped, the two moved to meet them.\n\nWhen the soldiers opened the limousine door, Vice Administrator Guan Qiang of the National Cultural Heritage Administration stepped out with his staff to shake hands. “Comrades from the Heritage Administration—you’ve finally arrived.”\n\nAfter brief courtesies, Yu took several bound volumes from Huang and presented them with both hands. “Comrade, this is the complete catalog of the Taipei Palace Museum collection.” Guan received it with equal formality. His aide produced a red-headed document, which Guan likewise handed over with both hands.\n\n“Deputy Director, this is the ‘Notice of the National Cultural Heritage Administration on the Assumption of the Taipei Palace Museum and Its Socialist Transformation.’ Please acknowledge receipt.” Seeing the bold line “Document of the National Cultural Heritage Administration,” the two deputies nodded their assent.\n\n“On behalf of the Central People’s Government, I solemnly affirm: from this day forward, your institution will continue as the Taipei Branch of the Palace Museum, Beijing. The great majority of the collection will remain in situ. Museum staff, upon passing political vetting, will remain in post.”\n\nHaving explained the Central Government’s approach and posture, Guan added, “As for your former director, Chen Chi-nan—he attempted to abscond to Japan with museum artifacts. Our forces apprehended him. He will face the judgment of the law.”\n\nThe two deputies indicated they accepted this outcome. “Comrades, please come this way.” With the handover complete, Guan and the Heritage Administration staff, escorted by PLA soldiers and led by the two deputies, entered through the museum’s main doors."

Inside, every trace of “Taiwan independence” sloganeering had been removed.\n\nLi Ran, a restoration specialist from the Palace Museum (Beijing), held a tablet tallying the collection by count and type; Chen Meiqi, a researcher from Taipei, assisted beside him. Though the two institutions were now one in principle, the handover was crucial, and the cross-Strait conservation teams still needed to find their rhythm.\n\nChen prompted Li to confirm the transfer list: The “Draft of a Requiem to My Nephew” to the National Edition Museum in Xi’an; the “Yellow-Glazed Green-Enamel Dragon Bowl” to the Palace Museum in Beijing; the “Cold Food Observance at Huangzhou” and the Mao Gong Ding to the National Museum of China; “Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains—Wuyong Scroll” and “Remaining Mountain” reunited at the Zhejiang Provincial Museum. Li checked and nodded.\n\nMeanwhile, PLA soldiers carefully crated the pieces, loading them aboard Y-20 transports under escort by a flight of J-20s bound for the mainland.\n\nNotably, the “Draft of a Requiem to My Nephew” had nearly been smuggled to Japan by former director Chen Chi-nan, before being intercepted by PLA special operations forces.\n\nAt the exhibit entrance, staff from both sides tested a “Digital Palace: A Cross-Strait Tour” VR program. Lin Xiaoyu from the mainland donned the visor and reported seamless switching between the virtual Beijing Palace Museum and the physical Taipei site—ready for opening day. “OK la,” the tester on the Taiwan side replied in island lilt.\n\nRenovations raced the clock. New director Shan Jixiang stood before the museum’s new Conservation Science Center, watching technicians mend pieces damaged through the dereliction of the prior leadership, recalling the Heritage Administration’s charge to him. Seeing the care lavished on each artifact, he nodded, reassured.\n\nOutside, apart from preserving the Sun Yat-sen Memorial and the “All Under Heaven for the Public” arch, the words “National Palace Museum, Taipei” had come down, replaced with “Palace Museum, Beijing—Taipei Branch” in simplified characters.\n\nOn the flanking poles and atop the main roof, the Five-Star Red Flag rose—marking a new beginning for cultural integration across the Strait."

Most notably, this round greatly eases entry for Taiwan professionals and capital, with heavyweight moves on mutual recognition of professional qualifications, wider investment access, and business facilitation.\n\nThe measures are generating a powerful pull: despite threats from the Taiwan authorities, large numbers of Taiwan professionals and investors are flocking to the mainland to work and build businesses.\n\nMajor cross-Strait business associations, longstanding Taiwan-funded enterprises on the mainland, and Taiwan compatriot communities generally view the new policies as a major boon. Analysts note that over the long term the policies will deepen economic and social linkages and build both material and public-opinion foundations for peaceful development across the Strait.\n\nSome international observers have noted the delicate timing. Experts at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute argue the move is not only a significant policy shift but also a deft signal of the mainland’s clear bottom line on unification—a form of “soft deterrence” that warns certain secessionist actors on the island that continued provocation will carry real costs.\n\nA handful of voices counsel caution, worrying that, given the complex environment, deeper political calculations behind the measures could raise friction—and even risk a new Taiwan Strait crisis."

The root cause of current tension and turbulence in the Strait is the Democratic Progressive Party authorities and figures such as Tsai Ing-wen stubbornly clinging to a “Taiwan independence” stance and continuously provoking in pursuit of secession—rushing headlong down a dead-end road. Taiwan is an inalienable, sacred part of Chinese territory; we will never allow any “Taiwan independence” force, under any name or in any form, to separate Taiwan from China. Any force or act that seeks to split the motherland will be met head-on by the Chinese people!\n\nZhu further pointed out: behind the recent aggravation of the Taiwan issue we see certain countries stirring the pot and backing secessionists. We condemn this in the strongest terms. We will never allow any external force to interfere in China’s internal affairs under pretexts of “freedom” or “democracy.” We urge the relevant countries to cease meddling; if they remain obstinate and continue to stoke regional tension, they will pay an ever-heavier price."

Core Reasons for Breakdown  \nThe Taiwan side tabled political demands that are wholly unacceptable:\n\n1) Sovereignty-splitting demands  \n— Require our side to sign a document recognizing the continued “sovereignty” of the Republic of China.  \n— Insist on retaining “Taiwan” participation as UN observer and keeping 22 so-called “diplomatic allies.”\n\n2) Military independence  \n— Reorganize the Taiwan military into an independently commanded “Taiwan Strait Defense Force.”  \n— Retain missile units and refuse CMC command.  \n— Demand routine calls by Japanese and Australian warships at Kaohsiung.\n\n3) Partition of governing authority  \n— Require that any PRC laws involving Taiwan be subject to review by Taiwan “courts.”  \n— Assert Taiwan courts’ jurisdiction over our institutions stationed in Taiwan.  \n— Demand the right to conclude treaties with international organizations independently.\n\n\nII. Red-Line Violations\n— The Taiwan delegation included former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, who led drafting of a “security clause” to set up a Japan–Australia–Taiwan military confidence mechanism.  \n— Taiwan’s text explicitly demands “our side’s legal recognition of Taiwan’s current constitutional order,” directly negating the constitutional principle that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.\n\n\nIII. Key Timeline  \n— Day 2: Our side presented a revised “One Country, Two Systems—Taiwan Plan” with 32 safeguards.  \n— Day 3: Taiwan tabled a “Memorandum on Cross-Strait Political Relations” containing sovereignty-dispute clauses.  \n— Day 4: Taiwan demanded Japan and Australia serve as “security guarantors,” leading to suspension.  \n— Day 7: Taiwan refused to sign the “One Country, Two Systems—Taiwan Plan,” causing complete breakdown.\n\n\nIV. Conclusion\nGrounded in a stance of “mutual non-subordination,” the Taiwan authorities raised 8 categories and 37 items of political demands that shattered our sovereignty bottom line, dooming the talks. In particular, stationing “Japanese forces in Taiwan” and “legally recognizing Taiwan’s constitutional order” would constitute de facto acts of state partition.\n\nFollow-on Recommendations:\nSubmit to the Center a motion to initiate legislation of a National Unification Law, and, in accordance with law, adopt resolute measures to safeguard national unity—ready to realize unification by iron and blood if necessary."

Our revised “One Country, Two Systems—Taiwan Plan,” with 32 safeguards, was tabled in good faith, but the Taiwan side clung to a secessionist stance, causing negotiations to fail.\n\nTaiwan demanded that our side sign a document acknowledging so-called “sovereign continuity” and insisted on participating in international organizations under the name “Taiwan.”\nTaiwan asserted independent military command and sought to bring in external military forces.\nTaiwan demanded that PRC laws involving Taiwan be subject to its approval and that its courts exercise jurisdiction over our institutions.  \nThese elements directly repudiate the constitutional principle that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. Our delegation stressed there is no room for negotiation on any secessionist proposition.\n\nIn the final stage, Taiwan refused to sign the peaceful unification plan and proposed inserting external actors into a Taiwan Strait security architecture—an egregious violation of the broadly observed one-China principle—thereby causing the talks to end.\n\nAuthorities noted that the Taiwan authorities’ conduct constitutes a substantive challenge to national unification. Our side will unswervingly advance the cause of unity and, in accordance with law, take all necessary measures to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nIn the wake of these talks, many regional analysts judge that as the global landscape slides further toward disorder, the Taiwan Strait crisis has an arrow already notched to the bow."

United States: Deterioration continues  \nSince the new U.S. administration took office, social contradictions have deepened.  \nDisruptions from the oil crisis still strain supply chains; political polarization is intensifying; many states have seen large-scale protests, with localized breakdowns of public order.  \nLaw-enforcement response is constrained by political gridlock; security is unlikely to improve in the near term.  \n\nII. Saudi Arabia: Instability threatens energy security  \nRisks persist in the Kingdom; in the eastern oil belt, clashes between security units and local armed elements have recurred.  \nAlthough crude output continues, pipeline security has been raised to wartime posture and requires close watch.  \n\nIII. Russia: Political risk is rising markedly  \nSplits are evident in the State Duma; the Shilavik bloc faces a combined challenge from opposition forces and regional elites.  \nUnauthorized mass gatherings have continued this week in Moscow and St. Petersburg; intelligence indicates some military figures are of uncertain alignment.  \n\nIV. Europe: Political realignment accelerating  \nRecent elections show anti-establishment parties taking 23%, 18%, and 31% of seats in France, Germany, and Italy, respectively.  \nOf note: emergent populist groups are promoting cross-border mobilization; multiple states have seen “exit NATO” demonstrations; NATO faces risk of unraveling.  \n\nV. Africa: Resource competition intensifies  \nMilitary alert levels have spiked along the Nile basin; four states around Lake Chad exchanged border fire over water allocation.  \n\nReported to: General Office of the CPC Central Committee; General Office of the State Council; CMC Joint Operations Command Center  \nCC: MFA, MND, MOFCOM, National Energy Administration, Overseas Chinese Affairs Office"

Core Objective\nSeize full control of the Diaoyu Islands within 72 hours; destroy or expel illegal JSDF forces on the islands; emplace radar sites, air-defense positions, and permanent fortifications to secure the Taiwan campaign.\n\nII. Enemy Assessment\nOn the main island, a company-plus of JSDF troops have sited observation posts, MG nests, and anti-ship missile teams on Gaohua Peak and Shennong Peak; on the North Islet, a platoon holds Eagle Peak, with Kongming Rock and Lion Ridge forming a cross-fire web; on the South Islet, a platoon fortifies Fist Ridge and uses Thumb Peak to seal the northern waters.\n\nIII. Our Disposition\nAssault Force: Marine Battalion 2 (480 personnel), with three landing infantry companies and one fire-support company.\nSea-based Fires Group: One Type-052D destroyer to suppress main-island high ground; three Type-054A frigates to suppress North/South Islet strongpoints; nine landing craft for lift; one amphibious assault ship for overall support.\n\nIV. Concept of Operations\nPreliminary Destruction: T-30 to T-0, the 130 mm guns of the 052D plaster Gaohua Peak; the 054A group strikes Eagle Peak (North) and Fist Ridge (South).\nVertical/Surface Landing: On the main island’s west shore, Marine Companies 1 and 2 storm ashore to establish a lodgment; the fire-support company emplaces mortar pits on the beachhead. On the North Islet’s northwest shore, Marine Company 3 raids Kongming Rock; the 052D blocks any eastward JSDF withdrawal. On the South Islet’s north rocks, 1st Platoon lands to take Thumb Peak, coordinating with 054As to collapse Fist Ridge defenses.\nControl & Consolidation: Engineer detachments follow to emplace air-defense missile sites and anti-landing obstacles.\n\nV. Risk Mitigation\nIf air defense is degraded, the 054A group will intercept with HQ-10 CIWS missiles; if the landing stalls, a reserve will conduct a second landing on the main island’s west to cut enemy retreat. The 052D retains eight YJ anti-ship missiles on guard."

Background  \nPursuant to CMC Transfer Order No. 45, our brigade’s Marine Battalion 3 executed the assumption of control over the Matsu Islands. Sovereignty over the islands lies clearly with our side; they were formerly garrisoned by the Taiwan puppet forces.  \n\nII. Course of Action  \nAt 300 m from shore, the landing craft sighted roughly sixty armed personnel on the west beach erecting hasty works and broadcasting by loudhailer that they would “block an illegal landing.”\nWe activated the contingency: two Z-20 helicopters established vertical overwatch; a Type-054A frigate advanced to set a fires cordon.  \nIntelligence confirmed the force as 3rd Battalion, 4th Coastal Brigade of the Taiwan puppet forces, likely agitated by a third party.  \nDuring the standoff, two armed individuals discharged weapons without orders; our snipers employed stun rounds to suppress—no casualties.  \nAfter comms coordination, the opposing force surrendered in full.\n\nIII. Results  \n1) Rapid action completed an all-island defensive layout; key facilities suffered zero damage.  \n2) Seized 17 items of abandoned enemy equipment (including a satellite comms terminal, transferred to the Technical Reconnaissance Bureau).  \n3) Maintained strict fire discipline throughout; no live exchange of fire."

  twgui.1032.d: "\"It’s a deal. Get your submarine into Tainan Harbor. I’ll board with the goods—we have an agreement.\"\n\nPeering through the tinted window of a black sedan as scenery whipped by, Chen Chi-nan kept his phone glued to his ear, bargaining with a Japanese buyer on the other end.\n\n\"Also—I hear a certain big tycoon wants Draft of a Requiem to My Nephew. Fine. One price: 300 million yen. Not a yen less.\"\n\nA long bout of verbal fencing followed until the voice on the line promised to pay—and to guarantee him a life of luxury. Only then did Chen lower his aching arm and glance at the inventory beside him.\n\n\"The Mao Gong Ding—pieces that big we’ll never move once the PLA attacks. But small works—Draft of a Requiem, scrolls, minor artifacts—those we can crate and load onto the Japanese submarine. Sell them to the zaibatsu and I’ll never want for anything again.\"\n\nCounting his winnings before they hatched, Chen thumbed through a list he had spirited out of the National Palace Museum in Taipei. From 2018 until his forced resignation in 2019, he had used his powers as museum director to push “localization” and shift collections south to the new Tainan branch. He hadn’t planned on the pace of events: the PLA Navy now sealed the island, and the current director, Wu Mi-cha, had fled on the eve of the operation, abandoning the museum to save his own skin.\n\nEscape mattered less to Chen than leverage. He knew the JMSDF or Royal Australian Navy would see no value in extracting him personally—but the artifacts in his custody were another matter. Now racing south from Taipei, he meant to reach Tainan, load the crates, and disappear beneath the waves.\n\nHe was still savoring his new life in Japan when a faint helicopter thrum reached the cabin. A burst of sharp reports followed. A Z-20 swung into view off the flank.\n\n\"Stop at once!\" Before Chen could shout \"Punch through!\" the front and rear tires blew out with surgical precision. Metal scraped the asphalt; the sedan bled speed and coasted to a halt. In seconds, a door was wrenched open; hands plucked Chen out like a chick, pinned him face-down on the road, and snapped cold cuffs on his wrists."

  twgui.1033.d: " I. Background  \nPursuant to the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, the Anti-Secession Law, and related legal principles; in order to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, advance the cause of complete national reunification, and answer the common will of the 1.4 billion Chinese people—including our compatriots in Taiwan—the Sixth Session of the 13th National People’s Congress has deliberated the State Council’s motion to establish the People’s Government of Taiwan Province.\n\n II.

  twentybig.1.d: "Back in his office, Xi Jinping let his gaze rest on the map upon the wall—national unification accomplished. A tide of feeling rose in him. For years, that goal had stood like a lighthouse, guiding generations of Chinese forward through nights of work and days of strain.\n\nAt last, a measure of completion—however qualified—had been reached.\n\nHe sank into the chair that had borne witness to so much of his life and turned over the question of staying on. His fingers tapped the armrest; his eyes showed a touch of uncertainty, mingled with attachment.\n\nEvery corner of the office had become familiar and dear. He knew the whisper of turning pages, the particular weight of bending to work under the lamp. Unification done, a newly whole country still faced tasks without number; his experience and craft remained of use.\n\nBut the years on the post had been long. Black hair to white, the toll had been paid not only in time but in health. He worried that habits forged over years might not best suit the nation’s next phase—and could, unmeant, become a drag on innovation.\n\nThe young brought fresher thinking and quicker adaptation, less bound by the grooves carved by contending interests in the past. If he stayed, he would occupy a place that might belong to those brimming with new energy; he would not cast his shadow over their urge to change and create.\n\nHe sat, thoughts circling between staying on and stepping away, while the clock kept its patient beat. Time moved, neither hurried nor slow.\n\nA choice awaited—about the 20th Party Congress, about the country, and about himself."

The great edifice loomed like a giant at the city’s heart—solemn, austere.\n\nInside, soft, clear light greeted the eye like a gracious host, a gauze of glow settling over every corner—polished marble underfoot, exhibits here and there—each touched by the light as if quickened.\n\nA long conference table anchored the hall, its surface catching a craftsman’s sheen, a low starlight glimmer.\n\nPeople flowed in, voices a brook’s murmur that pooled into harmony—some speaking of hopes for the session, eyes bright; others quietly trading notes on recent work, smiles slipping on and off.\n\nSoon they found their places, faces turning earnest, spirits lifted. Chairs slid with the faintest scrape, and the whispers, as if cued, ebbed to stillness. The hall lay like a placid lake, ordered and quiet.\n\nA moment later the welcoming march swelled, a noble, rousing strain. Xi Jinping and the other members of the Standing Committee entered in turn. With their seating, the meeting began.\n\nAt the rostrum, the speaker rose, ramrod straight. A resonant voice filled the hall: “Esteemed comrades, we are gathered to deliberate matters of development…. The General Secretary will now address us.”\n\nXi rose, face grave, stepping with steady force toward the lectern."

We have upheld and strengthened the Party’s overall leadership and the Central Committee’s centralized, unified leadership; safeguarded and improved people’s livelihoods; concentrated forces to win the battle against poverty; advanced ecological civilization; resolutely safeguarded national security; forestalled and defused major risks; and comprehensively carried forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n\nConfronted with the sudden COVID-19 outbreak, we put the people and life first; maintained the strategy of guarding against imported cases and domestic resurgences; held fast to dynamic zero-COVID; and waged a people’s war, an all-out war, and a blocking action—to the greatest extent protecting people’s lives and health while coordinating epidemic control with economic and social development.\n\nFacing an energy crisis, we pressed ahead with reform across the board with great political courage—gnawing hard bones, crossing dangerous shoals, tackling new contradictions, breaking the shackles of outworn ideas and entrenched interests, and cutting away institutional maladies.\n\nFacing the separatist activities of the “Taiwan independence” forces and armed interference by external powers, we resolutely restarted the People’s Liberation War that had lain dormant for nearly seventy years, demonstrating our firm will and strong capability to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity with revolutionary arms against counterrevolutionary arms—and we completed the cause our revolutionary martyrs left unfinished.\n\nAmid dramatic shifts in the international landscape, especially the reordering set off by the U.S. civil war, we put national interests first and domestic priorities foremost, kept strategic composure, carried forward the fighting spirit, built a community with a shared future for mankind, and formed the East Asia Defense Initiative (EADI), firmly seizing the initiative in our development and security.\n\nComrades!\n\nThe times call us; the people expect of us. The whole Party must remain true to our original aspiration and founding mission; stay modest, prudent, and hard-working; dare to struggle and be good at struggle; strengthen historical confidence; and enhance historical initiative—so we may write an even more splendid chapter of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era."

We have reached a key node on the road to national rejuvenation. I hold firm confidence in the prospect of building advanced socialism by 2049.\n\nThe world is undergoing changes unseen in a century. We will need new measures and new transformations—and, above all, the Party needs a younger corps of leading cadres. In light of the nation’s present circumstances and my own, I hereby submit to the National People’s Congress and its Standing Committee, and to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, my request to resign the offices of President of the People’s Republic of China and General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee.\n\nI am confident that, whomever the Party Central Committee and the Chinese people choose as successor, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the building of socialist modernization, and the Second Centenary Goal will be achieved through the Party’s and the people’s hard struggle.\n\n                                                                                     Xi Jinping"

  twentybig.6.d: "The old man leaned into the back of the chair, fingertips stroking the faintly yellowed resignation letter. “Old Xu…”—a sigh followed, then only the rustle of paper. His eyes fixed on the last three characters of the signature. Like Zhang Youxia, he too was an old comrade…\n\n“Age comes, and the days grow shorter.”\n\nWhen you walk at the head of hundreds of millions, how many will truly be your friends? The question circled his ears. He still sat there without moving. In that moment, he was simply an ordinary, solitary old man.\n\nA knock—three soft raps—sent ripples through the still air. He rose, opened the door, and met the familiar smile. “You must rest more. Health is the capital of revolution.”\n\nThe visitor smiled; he smiled back, as always. They sat shoulder to shoulder on the sofa, and once the talk-box opened it could not be shut. The two old friends spoke of many things—from affairs of state to children’s schooling—just as in their youth, nothing left unsaid. The moon outside climbed higher. Naturally, he voiced his plea to stay on.\n\n“Old, old. These old bones can’t carry on. The little brats across the Strait are dealt with—time to leave room for the young.”\n\n“Old Xu… I keep thinking: after the fighting, when will we few old fellows take a trip to Japan, or wander around Australia, or at worst go have a look at Sun Moon Lake? If we keep grinding on, there’ll be no time.” With an arm around his old friend, the Chairman laughed with unaccustomed ease.\n\nXu smiled in return and steered the talk elsewhere. The bright moon inched upward; the conversation flowed on.\n\nA breeze sifted the leaves outside, whispering a soft susurrus. With that wind, the land of China slept in peace. No one noticed the quiet reunion of two ordinary old men—still less the future they plotted.\n\n…\n\nThe moon slipped through thin cloud and began its slow, steady descent.\n\nThe wind brushed his graying hair. One hand on the doorframe, he watched Old Xu’s retreating back and let out a long sigh.\n\nMoonlight silvered his temples. Beside the frame, the knuckles’ creases told of years. When the figure was gone, he closed the door softly. Smiling, sighing, and a little alone."

It would take time yet to reach this border city.\n\nEven so, conditions were much improved, and the curriculum brimmed with new, creative content. Setting down his red pen and about to stretch, he heard a burst of spirited shouting outside—club period for the wargaming society.\n\n“Our corps is attacking Bengbu, one step from Xuzhou—why aren’t the Pingjin forces marching south?”\n\n“Baoding’s about to fall—march south? Who do you think I am, Chen Changjie?”\n\nThey were running a full-map campaign of the Liberation War; the after-action “blame game” was, as always, the favorite part. For kids in a border city to enjoy education like this—and squeeze in a tabletop battle after class—would have been unthinkable ten years ago.\n\nMr. Wang picked up the pace grading.

  PRC_FP_GUI: "The Battle Against Poverty"
  PRC_FP_GUI_desc: "Since the founding of New China, the Communist Party of China has led the people in an unrelenting war on poverty. Through the reform-and-opening era, we forged a path of poverty alleviation with Chinese characteristics, lifting more than 700 million rural residents out of poverty and laying a solid foundation for completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. China became the country that has reduced poverty for the largest number of people and the first to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals.\nYet by the end of 2014, over 70 million rural residents remained in poverty.\nIn light of this, the central authorities set the 13th Five-Year Plan target: by 2020, to ensure the rural poor no longer worry about food and clothing, and that compulsory education, basic medical care, and safe housing are guaranteed; meanwhile, to ensure per capita disposable income in poor areas grows faster than the national average, and key indices of basic public services approach the national average.\nWe have reached the stage of gnawing the hardest bones—assaulting fortified positions at a sprint. We must meet the final challenge with firmer resolve, clearer thinking, more precise measures, and extraordinary strength, so that no poor area and no poor person is left behind.\n\n§YTo build a moderately prosperous society in all respects is the CPC’s solemn pledge to the Chinese people.\nThe trumpet has sounded for the decisive battle against poverty.\nWith the will to move mountains, lock onto the target, work hard in earnest, and win the final victory—so that by 2020 all poor areas and people may stride together into a moderately prosperous society.§!\n\n§YNorth China:§!§G Task accomplished in full§!                    §YEast China:§!§G Task accomplished in full§!\n§YCentral China:§!§G Task accomplished in full§!                  §YNortheast:§G Task accomplished in full§!\n§YSouth China: [PRC_FP_HN]                    §YNorthwest: [PRC_FP_XB]\n§YSouthwest: [PRC_FP_XN]                      §YTaiwan: [PRC_FP_TW]"

Under the leadership of the CPC and through the efforts of hundreds of millions of Chinese, this final battle will eradicate absolute poverty—resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely.\n\nThis will be a great victory for the Chinese nation. The year 2020 is the year of decisive victory; the centuries-old yearning for a moderately prosperous life will become reality.\n\nIt will be a great victory for socialism. Eliminating poverty, improving people’s livelihoods, and realizing common prosperity are the essence of socialism and the Party’s solemn pledge to the people. Winning this battle condenses the CPC’s unwavering people-first purpose, displays the political strengths of CPC leadership and China’s socialist system, and gives concentrated expression to socialism’s essence and superiority.\n\nIt will be a great victory for humanity. Poverty alleviation is China’s cause—and humanity’s. Once the task is complete, roughly 100 million people in our country will have escaped poverty, achieving the UN 2030 Agenda’s poverty-reduction goal ten years ahead of schedule. No other nation has ever lifted so many people out of poverty in so short a time. This matters profoundly to China and to the world.\n\nTaking off the poverty label is not the end, but the starting point of a new life and new struggle.

  prc_fp.3.d: "A new chapter in the nation’s history has opened. At today’s National Poverty Alleviation Summary and Commendation Conference in Beijing, General Secretary Xi Jinping solemnly declared: our battle against poverty has achieved a complete victory!\n\nIn eight years, nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty; all 832 poor counties have shed the label. We launched a general offensive against deep poverty and gnawed through the hardest bones. Despite the pandemic, we completed the goals and tasks of the new era’s poverty alleviation on schedule, achieving the UN 2030 Agenda’s poverty-reduction target a decade early.\n\nLooking back, the results are world-shaking—won by the CPC’s unbroken struggle. Seeking happiness for the people is the Party’s original aspiration and mission; casting off poverty is its solemn promise and responsibility. For a century, the CPC has led the people through blood and fire and tireless effort to honor that aspiration and promise.\n\nThe whole Party moved quickly. Guided by targeted poverty alleviation, we answered whom to help, who should do the helping, how to help, and how to exit—building an effective support system that embodies the advantages of socialism. Behind each household’s escape from poverty stood a custom plan, a coordinated system project, and a hard battle that changed destinies—implementing the “six precisions” and the “five batches.” Through precise “drip irrigation” of national policy, the economy and society of poor areas accelerated markedly. With the united efforts of the Party and the people of all ethnic groups, we have completed the arduous task of eliminating absolute poverty and created yet another human miracle worthy of the annals."
