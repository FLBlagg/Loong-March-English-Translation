  City_View_1: "Beijing"
  City_View_desc_1: "Beijing—the Beijing of stories. Three millennia of walls, eight centuries a capital. Three enclosures and one axis; emperors on the frontier; the ancient trees of Coal Hill watching the court’s rise and fall. Banners parcel the city, walls crack and fall, and gardens turned to ruins drip a cold gray trickle. Fish and dragons mingle; ideas rise in waves; flying ink and paper howl out unruly chapters. Blue bricks and black tiles, lanes and courtyards; tame old cats counting sparrows winging home… Back then the gun smoke drifted off with the hawker’s cry of candied hawthorn, congealing who knows where into a moon in someone’s heart…\nBeijing—the Beijing in impressions. One paving brick can topple two bureau chiefs; in half a step you meet three Banner folk; an inch of land is worth its weight in gold, and a true Beijinger is hard to match in pride. Offal stew and hutongs—life can’t be told without them; housing prices and rat races—growth can’t escape them. The smog that ringed the walls has long blown away, but the labels that ring the regions still linger on and on.\nBeijing—the Beijing you can touch. Sling a stool and play chess all day on the street—that’s Beijing; nurse a coffee and code all day—that’s Beijing. Swallow your consonants in a lilting drawl and take it easy—that’s Beijing; speak north and south and hurry by—that’s Beijing. Hutong courtyards and neighborhood kin—that’s Beijing; towers and tenements, colleagues in and out—that’s also Beijing. Crosstalk and opera, earthy and plain—that’s Beijing; film and rock, elegant and rarefied—that’s still Beijing.\nBeijing: China’s Beijing, the Chinese people’s Beijing, the Chinese nation’s Beijing, the world’s Beijing.\nBeijing: not far-off Beijing, not far-off in time, not lonely, not ordinary.\nHer fate—and China’s fate—awaits the people’s own hands to hew.\n\n\nAUV! Bless~ings~ to~ you~!"

  City_View_2: "Tianjin"
  City_View_desc_2: "Growing where river meets sea, Tianjin shoulders the vital duty of serving the capital. The winding Hai River ties it to Beijing—its seaward gate and guardian. In the crushing defeats of the modern era, the guardian could only watch the capital fall—until the Republic’s founding in 1949. With reform and opening, Tianjin, the North China region’s greatest port and a key industrial city, has faithfully done its job. Keels of giants in Bohai Bay, engines thundering in the Air Port New Area, and the to-and-fro of the Beijing–Tianjin high-speed line—each shows the old city’s new innovation and vitality. Beneath the Drum Tower, the clack of the wake-wood in crosstalk teahouses and the steam from hot jianbing batter the senses with a market air all its own—and show folkways close to yet distinct from Beijing’s.\n\n\n\n\nClack go the bamboo clappers—no need to brag, but if we brag, we brag about Tianjin’s Gou~bu~li~ steamed~ buns~"

  City_View_3: "Shanghai"
  City_View_desc_3: "Shanghai sits at the Yangtze’s mouth—a modern, metropolitan city, and among the youngest in this ancient land. Since opening in 1843, it has been China’s leading window on the world. The inflow of Western capital birthed the country’s first modern industry and commerce; the Bund’s Western towers became an emblem still kept today. Yet the overture of prosperity was scored with partition by colonizers and the nation’s humiliation; the crisscrossing concessions were a miniature of the semi-feudal, semi-colonial order. But here too, where the first and largest modern working class took shape, the Communist Party of China was born in 1921—giving Shanghai a singular place in history. The famed Central Special Branch worked here as well, feeding the Central Committee a lifeline of intelligence and funds.\nIn 1949, with Shanghai’s liberation, the city’s fate truly came into the people’s hands—and it has remained the Republic’s economic center ever since. Over the next seventy-plus years, growth quickened; after reform-and-opening and the launch of Pudong, Shanghai surged into an international financial and trade hub that Asia—and the world—must watch. In the new century, with a civic spirit that is broad and inclusive, striving for excellence, open and wise, magnanimous and modest, Shanghai keeps leading China’s innovation and growth—showing the world the great force and endless possibility of modernizing an ancient nation.\n\n\nVIP to 600 Wanping South Road, please~"

  City_View_4: "Chongqing"
  City_View_desc_4: "Chongqing, a mountain city where the Yangtze meets the Jialing: its sharp terrain has shaped a one-of-a-kind 8D magic—cableways strung across the river, light rail threading through apartment blocks, uncountable stairways and elevators linking the city’s layers, and interchanges so convoluted even locals can get lost. Like Sichuan next door, this is also a hotpot capital—boiling red broth steams up the spicy, numbing street life and the forthright warmth of the people. As the Yangtze’s key upriver port, giant ships call here without cease, sending goods to the vast hinterland and the seas. Once a wartime auxiliary capital, it is now one of China’s greatest industrial bases, a twin core of the Southwest together with Chengdu. When night falls, lights blaze along both rivers’ four banks like a spilled Milky Way; mountains and city mingle; the river runs on—just like Chongqing’s three thousand years of history, racing from the past toward the future.\n\n\nChengdu’s next door—not here; the local specialty is hotpot, not……"

  City_View_5: "Hong Kong"
  City_View_desc_5: "One of Asia’s Four Little Dragons, Hong Kong sits east of the Pearl River mouth. It is a world-class center of finance, trade, and shipping, where British colonizers, locals, and migrants from Guangdong lived together for over a century—and where East and West collided and fused into a culture notably open and diverse. Since the 1997 handover, Hong Kong has developed in step with the Republic’s rise. Yet the poison of colonialism was never fully leached away—directly abetting the 2019 black-riot turmoil, which brought disaster and instability. Now, as the aftermath slowly fades, Hong Kong is working to fuse itself into the national development grand plan: the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge binds the two Special Administrative Regions to the Pearl River Delta; the Greater Bay Area is a rare, wide-open opportunity that is pouring fresh energy into the city.\n\n\nYou eat your Life Bread; I’m off to Shenzhen for Haidilao!"

  City_View_6: "Macau"
  City_View_desc_6: "Macau, on the west bank of the Pearl River mouth, is China’s smallest provincial-level region—and the only lawful gaming-and-tourism hub within China—hailed as the Las Vegas of the East. In truth, Macau is the world’s number one gaming city, and thanks to its tiny area, among the world’s most densely populated—facts few recall. Since the 1999 handover, the city’s small population and the gaming sector’s huge revenues have given it top-tier social welfare by Chinese—and global—standards. The famed Portuguese egg tart also comes from Macau, its unique flavor beloved the world over. For the foreseeable future, this sleepless city on the South China Sea will remain a singular view at the river’s mouth, drawing visitors without number.\n\n\n“Las Vegas of the East?” Las Vegas ought to be called the Macau of the West."

  City_View_7: "Daqing"
  City_View_desc_7: "Daqing, the bearer of Chinese oil workers’ hopes and dreams, is famed for its oilfield. Rising in the heart of the Songnen Plain, this oil city overturned Soviet and Japanese claims—proving that the vast black earth indeed hid industry’s lifeblood. This is the cradle of New China’s petroleum sector; countless pumpjacks nod day and night, tracing the city’s most distinct skyline. The Iron Man Wang Jinxi’s shouts and the founding spirit have merged into its genes with each worker’s toil. Lakes and wetlands speckle the map of this “City of a Hundred Lakes.” By night, derricks and factories answer the stars with their own lights. However the future turns, Daqing will always hold its chapter in New China’s annals—of a city and the oil workers who made it.\n\n\n§RThen who’s going to make up my oil shortfall, huh?§!\nThrow that “short of oil” hat clear across the Pacific—let it land in the Middle East."

  City_View_8: "Harbin"
  City_View_desc_8: "Harbin, an “Ice City” in full bloom on the Songhua’s banks. Bitter cold forged its unique bone and bred dreamlike wonders of ice and snow—the crystalline castles of the Ice and Snow World are winter’s fairy tale for the earth; the Sun Island Snow Expo carves the romance of the North. As a key industrial base, the roar of the “three great powerplants” once beat like China’s industrial pulse; Harbin Institute of Technology, first among the “Seven Sons of National Defense,” is the city’s pride—one of the brightest stars in the Republic’s defense science. Under Saint Sophia’s dome, vendors hawk red sausage and da lie ba; frothing borscht sends up a sweet aroma, telling of the unique flavor where Russian and Chinese civilizations met. With ice and snow’s magic, Russian grace, and deep industry, Harbin writes its own history on the broad northern frontier.\n\n\nWhoa! That’s not an ice sculpture—it’s a sculpture of the sou—"

  City_View_9: "Qiqihar"
  City_View_desc_9: "After the Manchurian Incident, Ma Zhanshan took office in Qiqihar as acting governor of Heilongjiang and commander-in-chief, led his troops to strike back, and at Jiangqiao fired the first shot of Chinese resistance against the Japanese invasion. Some called him a bandit, some a warlord—but either way, he sowed the seed of resistance, and fourteen years of Northeast struggle began there.\nToday the once-heroic city is like a sun going down: slow growth, environmental strain. Every Qiqihar native carries a wish to see the city regain provincial-capital glory—and all are ready to toil for it, just waiting for a chance to begin…\n\n\nHow the former capital of Heilongjiang clawed from a fifth-tier city up to a fourth-tier one\nHeavy industry? Aren’t those just barbecue stands?"

  City_View_10: "Changchun"
  City_View_desc_10: "Known as the “Spring City beyond the Pass,” Changchun rose from the deep black earth of the Northeast. Its pulse beats with the steadiness and grit of the wide plain. The generous bounty of the fields makes it a pillar of the “granary of the nation”; golden rice and green corn are the best return on the people’s labor. History’s chisel cut deep here too: the grand complexes of the warlord and Manchukuo periods, and the siege of Changchun in the Liberation War, all tell the saga of a nation that woke from humiliation and rose from ruins. Here came the first roar of New China’s auto industry—the robot arms and lines of FAW keep alive the fathers’ vow to “shoulder the Republic’s industrial spine.” Every car rolling off the line carries the undimmed dream of the “eldest son of the Republic.”\nAs Jilin’s capital and core, Changchun feeds the country with its abundant grain and props up the age with the bone of industry—witnessing China’s past and future on this black earth.\n\n\nCommander, we’ve talked it over with the Communists—if you nod now, it still counts as defecting!"

  City_View_11: "Dalian"
  City_View_desc_11: "Set where the Bohai and Yellow Seas meet, Dalian has the sea’s breadth and resilience in its bones. The silent batteries at Lüshunkou and the scabbed bricks of the old Japanese–Russian prison tell, without words, the port city’s rising and falling fate; in the auditorium at Laohutan, countless sailors began their blue road. As time’s river ran, Dalian tempered its tangled past into a character open and inclusive.\nAs the Northeast’s most important—and only—seaport, the gantry cranes of Dalian Port work day and night, sending “Made in China” out along the world’s arteries. Farther into the deep blue, modern sea ranches spread quietly, nursing hopes of a “granary on the water.” In the docks of Dalian Shipbuilding, the launch of Liaoning and Shandong announced the People’s Navy’s blue-water ambition.\nWhen sunset gilds the Coastal Road, and harbor lights dance with neon on the sea, Dalian proves this: a great port can swallow the sails of all nations, forge a steel great wall at sea, and still let life’s poetry perch at ease in surf and city smoke.\n\n\nYou’re fantasizing again—actually the Soviets never returned Dalian; before the USSR collapsed the U.S. took control and built the famous Dalian (Da-li-an) Shipyard, with a single dock turning out five Burke Flight III destroyers… Also, why call “Leoning State” ‘Liaoning Province’?"

  City_View_12: "Jinzhou"
  City_View_desc_12: "Jinzhou—“a brocade land”—was founded in the Liao by Yelü Abaoji “making Jinzhou with Chinese captives.” It is the regional center of western Liaoning and a key logistics hub for the Northeast. South on the Bohai and throttling the Liaoxi Corridor, it has always been a choke point for war. This was the field of the Ming–Qing Songjin campaigns and of the Liaoshen Campaign in the Civil War. Today it links the Northeast to North China and anchors the Bohai Rim as a major port—and is an important ring in the new-era revitalization of the Northeast.\n“Heroic city—Jinzhou delivers.”\n\n\n\n\nThe barbecue here is world-famous—and the accent ques↑tions↓ ev↑erything!"
  
  City_View_13: "Shenyang"
  City_View_desc_13: "Shenyang, commanding the heart of the Liao River Plain, is the heavyweight of the Northeast and the capital of Liaoning. Birthplace of the Qing dynasty, the red walls and golden tiles of the Mukden Palace and the dark pines of Beiling whisper of that complex past. The “September 18th” History Museum records the bitterness and humiliation of the fourteen-year War of Resistance, a constant reminder to stay vigilant in times of peace. As the “eldest son” of the Republic’s industry, the roar from the forest of factories in Tiexi District symbolizes not only victory in the Civil War, but also stands as witness to the nation’s industrial history. The Shenyang Aircraft Corporation—beloved by military buffs—has concentrated the labor of defense workers for seventy years; here the Flanker airframe took root and branched, giving the People’s Liberation Army Air Force one of the world’s most advanced heavy 4th-generation fighter line-ups. Today, new-era industrial parks such as the Sino-German Equipment Manufacturing Park are driving an upgrade to “intelligent manufacturing,” and Shenyang is poised to lead the Northeast’s transformation and revitalization.\n\n\nYou’ve made it to Shenyang—there’s surely no “good juice” waiting for you!"

  City_View_14: "Dandong"
  City_View_desc_14: "Dandong, a border city nestled in the crook of the Yalu River, where the silence of boundary stones mingles with the murmuring of waves. Known to many only through internet memes, this “hero city” has a history tightly bound to the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and to the country across the river. Even before the full-scale War of Resistance, General Yang Jingyu led the Anti-Japanese United Army here against invasion; during the Civil War, countless men of Dandong joined the People’s Liberation Army and followed the Fourth Field Army to liberate the country; many Korean-Chinese soldiers, under Kim Il-sung, then took part in Korea’s war of liberation; and in the world-famous War to Resist America and Aid Korea, it was from here that the Chinese People’s Volunteers marched across the Yalu to fight in the founding war of the new state.\nToday’s Dandong is an ordinary border city, but it witnessed the valor of the Northeast’s sons and daughters and China’s rise from repeated invasions to renewal. And will it, perhaps, also witness unification and liberation on the far bank of the river?\n\n\nYou came from Dandong~ turn me snow-white~ and now you want to eat~ Can~ton~ese~ food~"

  City_View_15: "Hohhot"
  City_View_desc_15: "Hohhot—its Mongolian name means “Blue City”—sits in central Inner Mongolia, on the southern foot of the Yin Mountains beside the Dahei River, a tributary of the Yellow River. With over 430 years of urban history, this frontier city is both the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and a key hub linking North China and the Northwest—a model of the melding of steppe culture with agrarian civilization. The “Song of the Chile” hides in the grasses; the ruins of ancient Yunzhong Commandery endure. Zhaojun’s Green Tomb gazes at snow on the Yin Mountains; Guisui’s walls have fallen and risen, Suiyuan’s barracks gone quiet and loud again. The land once trodden by Mongol horses is now thick with towers of steel and concrete.\nHohhot is rising on the northern frontier with a new identity as “China’s Dairy Capital.” Giants like Mengniu and Yili went from here to the world, while the Horinger New Area’s data centers shoulder the national “East Data, West Computing” strategy. This grassland metropolis guards the cultural roots of a people of the saddle even as it writes a brilliant new chapter of modernization. No longer a remote post station, it’s the northern gate—left hand clasping the steppe, right hand reaching for the world.\n\n\nYou’re absolutely right: we ride horses to school, our exams test drawing the bow from horseback, and when you turn the tap, no water comes out—only gushing milk."

  City_View_16: "Tongliao"
  City_View_desc_16: "Tongliao, known in Mongolian as ‘Zhelimu’—meaning “saddle girth”—lies in eastern Inner Mongolia, at the western edge of the Songliao Plain, where the West Liao River meets the Jiaolai. On the Horqin grassland, this rising city was both the Qing-era confederation site for the ten banners of Zhelimu and a crucial transport node linking the Northeast with North China.\nHere, the symbiosis of steppe and agriculture is perfectly illustrated. The Kulun Three Temples of Tibetan Buddhism witness the blending of Mongol, Manchu, and Han cultures; the vermilion colonnades of the Naiman Prince’s Palace recall the governance of Mongol nobility in the Qing; the wheat seas of Kailu County and the cornfields of Horqin District together paint the harvest canvas of a “granary beyond the Great Wall.”\nTongliao is leaping from traditional farming and herding to modern industry. The “Tongliao Yellow Corn” brand is renowned nationwide; a hundred-billion-yuan beef-cattle cluster has formed; wind and photovoltaic energy surge ahead. The Jitong Railway and the Tongliao–Hohhot Railway cross here, while “Mengdong” China–Europe freight trains carry farm and animal products toward Eurasia.\nAnd yes, there’s also a certain mouse here, spinning tales and serving up “mealtime dramas” for viewers across the country.\n\n\nThe most famous modern internet celebrity here might just be…a mouse."

  City_View_17: "Ordos"
  City_View_desc_17: "Ordos—its Mongolian name means “many palaces”—is where the Yellow River traces its gentlest curve and the Mu Us sandy lands come to an end. Genghis Khan’s sulde still stands, and incense has risen at the Eight White Pavilions for eight centuries.\nAs a key national energy base, Ordos sits atop astonishing wealth. The Shendong coalfield produces more than 800 million tons of coal annually; the Sulige gas field supplies one-quarter of the natural gas used in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region; photovoltaic arrays in the Kubuqi Desert are turning yesterday’s “sea of death” into an “ocean of green electricity.”\nOrdos is shifting from coal dominance to a diversified economy. The world’s first zero-carbon industrial park has landed here; coal-to-liquid technologies have broken international blockades; cashmere output accounts for a third of the national total. The Baotou–Xi’an high-speed railway slices through the city, and the “Warm City” brand draws summer visitors. In the Yellow River’s bend, this energy capital is writing a new era of high-quality growth—with the ambition to “warm the whole world.”\n\n\nMany don’t know this: per-capita GDP here ranks first in China."

  City_View_18: "Tangshan"
  City_View_desc_18: "On Bohai Bay, at the southern foot of the Yan Mountains, Tangshan rose phoenix-like from the ruins of a great earthquake, winning the world’s attention for the resilience of the “Phoenix City.”\nAs China’s “steel capital,” Tangshan’s industrial backbone has supported the Republic’s development. It can roll steel into precision strip thinner than paper and fire ceramics so fine they are “white like jade and ring like a chime.” Dawn over Bohai stains the blast furnaces of New Shougang red; a welder’s visor reflects blue fire.\nThis city blends grit with tenderness. Each year before the 7.28 Earthquake Memorial Wall, flowers and quiet thoughts continue the remembrance of 240,000 lost lives; outside the lattice windows of Li Dazhao’s former residence, high-speed trains roar past. Today Tangshan is leaping from traditional heavy industry to the “one port, two cities” strategy. This hard-core city on Bohai Bay is composing its own “Heroic Symphony,” true to the quake-forged spirit of “placing the public above the self, sharing hardship together.”\n\n\n§RNo quake can break iron Tangshan! The Phoenix City marches on!§!\nTangshan’s steel capacity exceeds that of every country on earth except China itself—any thoughts?"

  City_View_19: "Shijiazhuang"
  City_View_desc_19: "“An ancient commandery of a thousand years, a city of a hundred years—New China set out from here.”\nLocated in the heart of the North China Plain on the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains, this “city pulled here by trains” transformed, to the whistle of modern railways, from a small village into a provincial capital. The Hutuo River runs through the city; the thousand-year cultural vein of Zhengding Old City and the red memories at the Liberation Monument together tell the land’s story. The Beijing–Guangzhou, Shijiazhuang–Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang–Dezhou railways intersect here, making it a key north–south, east–west hub. From the revolutionary footsteps of Xibaipo to the cutting-edge biomedicine clusters, Shijiazhuang has always borne the plain-spoken resilience of Yan–Zhao. Within the broader coordinated development of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, it is writing a new chapter of striving in a new era.\n\n\n\n\n“Thirty years living like this.” — from “Kill That Man from Changshan”"

  City_View_20: "Zhangjiakou"
  City_View_desc_20: "Zhangjiakou lies where the North China Plain gives way to the Inner Mongolian Plateau, at the meeting of the Yan Mountains and the remnants of the Yin Mountain range, forming a unique “mountain city beyond the Pass.” Known since antiquity as the “Key to the Capital,” it stood at the frontier where agrarian and nomadic civilizations met; the “Magnificent Rivers and Mountains” inscription over Dajing Gate bears witness to its storied past as a border stronghold.\nAs a main host of the 2022 Winter Olympics, it built the National Ski Jumping Center—“Snow Ruyi”—whose elegant curve echoes the ruins of the Great Wall, a dialogue of old and new. Zhangjiakou has kept a borderland spirit of openness and inclusiveness, and in the new era it writes a splendid transformation from military stronghold to eco-city with the stance of an “Olympic City.” The red lacquer of the Chahar Commander’s Office may peel, but the snowflake lights of the Olympic Village still glow—a city forever waiting for the wind.\n\n\nKids, I’m not Zhangjiajie."

  City_View_21: "Luoyang"
  City_View_desc_21: "Luoyang, the “Capital of Thirteen Dynasties,” has carved a brilliant chapter into the long river of Chinese civilization. The Xia, Shang, and Zhou made their capitals here; so too did the Han, Wei, Sui, and Tang. The Silk Road unfurled from here; Neo-Confucian learning took root here. Imperial tombs on Mount Bei Mang and the myriad Buddhas of the Longmen Grottoes together proclaim this land’s central place in Huaxia’s history.\nThe Longhai and Jiaoliu railways meet here, making the city a vital east–west link. CITIC Heavy Industries’ cavernous workshops stand alongside Luolong New District’s modern blueprint. The twin-innovation bases spark with energy. This ancient capital is alive with a vitality not seen in ages. It remembers the blinding brilliance of its days as the Divine Capital; it remembers the wartime westward relocation of steel and industry; it remembers the “ten great factories and mines” of the planned economy—and it embraces its new title as the “Museum City of the East.” Even as the young rush to the coasts, reeds along the Luo River green year after year.\nWhat is truly eternal needs no clamor—like the peony, which quietly blooms with Grain Rains.\n\n\nI’m the capital of thirteen dynasties… not Zhengzhou’s tag-along!"

  City_View_22: "Zhengzhou"
  City_View_desc_22: "Here, silt from the Yellow River settled into city walls three millennia old, while the chimes of the Erqi Tower have rung for only a century. Zhengzhou has long been one of the cradles of Huaxia civilization. 3,600 years ago, the Shang established their capital here, opening the brilliant chapter of one of China’s earliest capitals.\n“Made-in-Zhengzhou” smartphones go worldwide, and the “Zhengzhou Port” makes this inland place a new high ground of openness. It may not be anyone’s “white moonlight,” but it’s a waystation for millions chasing dreams: the Beijing–Guangzhou and Longhai rail arteries cross here at right angles, making the city a national integrated transport hub connecting north to south and east to west. Zhengzhou has kept the open spirit of being the “center of heaven and earth,” and in the strategy of a rising Central China, this ancient yet youthful city is, with a posture of “blending old and new,” bursting with unprecedented vitality—writing an epic from the ruins of the Shang capital to a National Central City.\n\n\nYou’re not wrong—but about that Zheng–Luo/Kai integration…"

  City_View_23: "Qingdao"
  City_View_desc_23: "Tides in Jiaozhou Bay wash the foundations of German-style buildings; the Huilan Pavilion on Zhanqiao Pier counts the years of passing ships. Here sea meets mountain, hops dance with whitecaps, and East and West collide in a unique rhythm. As a key coastal center city, it gathers world-class ports, regional headquarters of multinationals, and ocean research institutes. The century-old charm of Zhanqiao, the cosmopolitan villas of the Eight Great Passes, the exuberance of the Beer Festival, and the salty-smoky glow of seafood street stalls together tell how Qingdao changed from a Sino-German treaty port to an international metropolis—showing the world the surging vigor of China’s ocean economy.\nToday Qingdao is writing new history: high-speed trains “made in Qingdao” sprint across the globe; the Jiaolong submersible dives deep from here; the container terminals of Qingdao Port never sleep. No longer a colonial specimen, this young-old city is catching the wind in the sails of a national maritime strategy, with the unique charm of “red roofs, green trees; blue sea, blue sky,” becoming a vital window on China’s openness.\n\n\nThe village folk of Jimo and Chengyang; the old trend-chasers of Shinan, Shibei, and Laoshan;\nHuangdao’s nouveau riche, and Licang’s candied radish balls.\n(And no—Laixi and Jiaozhou don’t count as Qingdao folks.)"
  
  City_View_24: "Jining"
  City_View_desc_24: "Jining sits on the southwestern Shandong Plain, a hub on the Grand Canal—this “homeland of Confucius and Mencius” has carved one of the deepest cultural imprints on the map of Chinese civilization. The Si and Yi Rivers meet here with Weishan Lake, nurturing a brilliant arc from the Beixin Culture to the rise of Confucian thought. For a thousand years, canal barges came and went; the stone steps of Rencheng’s old wharf still hold the mercantile memory of the “Little Suzhou north of the Yangtze.” It remembers the Qianlong Emperor’s southern tours, the Canal Detachment during the War of Resistance, and the hard shift from a “coal city” to a “city famed for culture.”\nEvery stele in this city precipitates the codes of civilization. Ancient yet young, Jining is being reborn along the Grand Canal Cultural Belt under the dual identity of “the native place of Confucius and Mencius” and “a canal culture city,” becoming a spiritual home for feeling the pulse of Chinese civilization and experiencing traditional virtues.\n\n\nBow deeply and knock your head to the floor—respectfully."

  City_View_25: "Yantai"
  City_View_desc_25: "This city is like its Laiyang pear—rough on the outside, crisp-sweet within.\nTrue fairylands are not misty and illusory; they live in every honest dawn and dusk. Here, every cresting wave beats with an open pulse: six thousand years ago, people at the Baishi Site first raised sail; merchant ships from the old port of Dengzhou linked a Northeast Asian trade network; and the century glow of the Yantai Hill Lighthouse has never ceased to guide the way. Today, Yantai is fashioning new brilliance—Yantai apples perfume the world, the Blue Whale No. 1 drilling platform pushes into the deep blue, and the Chang’e-5 probe set off for the moon from here. Yantai keeps an ocean-wide embrace, writing a new blue epic within the strategy of building a maritime power. With classical poise and modern verve, “Fairyland Coast, Fresh Yantai” cuts through the swells, a vivid showcase of China’s coastal openness.\n\n\nHey man, you’re in the wrong place—Weihai is next door."

  City_View_26: "Jinan"
  City_View_desc_26: "The three plumes of Baotu Spring surge and settle; the lotus leaves of Daming Lake wither and thrive. This is the “house-to-house springs” of The Travels of Lao Can, the northern water city where the Seventy-Two Springs sing day and night. Between the “Nine Smoke-Points of Qi” and the Seventy-Two Famous Springs, the “City of Springs” paints its unique landscape poem. From the black pottery of the Longshan Culture to the hegemony of Qi and Jin in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States, more than 4,600 years of urban history answer to its renown as “the world’s city of springs.” As a vital bearer of Confucian culture, Luoyuan Academy by Baotu Spring continues the literary current of “This pavilion east of the sea is ancient; Jinan has many men of letters.”\nJinan is building a new future: the “Avenue of Quantum” gathers research strength, while the “Qilu” China–Europe Railway Express runs east to west. The Beijing–Shanghai high-speed rail and the Jiaoji railway cross here, lifting this “mighty capital of Qi and Lu” into a central city of the Yellow River Basin. From the classic Lu-cuisine dish Nine-Turn Intestines to spring-water banquets that fuse tradition and innovation, this city—both northernly bold and southernly delicate—now stands with the singular profile of “mountain–spring–lake–river–city,” a major window on the diversity of Chinese civilization within the Yellow River national strategy.\n\n\nDaming Lake, Lake so bright, in Daming Lake the lotuses lie. On the lotus sits a little frog—poke it once and see it hop.\nBaotu Spring, spring Baotu—three little eyes go glug-glug-glug, glug-glug-glug, glug-glug-glug, glug-glug-glug-glug-glug."

  City_View_27: "Dezhou"
  City_View_desc_27: "Dezhou lies on the northwestern Shandong Plain, where the Grand Canal crosses the old course of the Yellow River. Silt from the old Yellow River built this plain; the boatmen’s shanties of the Grand Canal have faded, yet the stele of “Nine Thoroughfares Reach the Firmament” still stands on the railway-station square. Between sail shadows of grain transport and the whistles of locomotives, the city composed a transport epic of its own. As a key node on the Grand Canal Cultural Belt, the exotic aura of the Tomb of the King of Sulu and the flood-control ingenuity of the Four Maidens Temple Hub testify to Dezhou’s distinctive wisdom.\n“Made-in-Dezhou” sports equipment serves global events; solar thermal technology leads industry standards; and an integrated-circuit sector rises quietly. From the ecological scroll of the Jian River wetlands to the industry-city fusion of Tianqu New District, this city of blended tradition and modernity strides ahead with the new image of “Nine Thoroughfares to Heaven, Dynamic Dezhou,” a living sample of high-quality development in North China. Dezhou keeps the civic virtue of “bearing all under Heaven with great moral force,” writing a vigorous new chapter in ecological protection and high-quality growth across the Yellow River Basin.\n\n\nI’m the State of Texas—I’m the State of Texas!"

  City_View_desc_28: "Waters of the Fen River washed out the foundations of ancient Jinyang. Zhao Jianzi raised its walls; Li Yuan raised his banner; Empress Wu designated it a northern capital. Through nine dynastic turns, imperial breath soaked every city brick. The fires of Emperor Taizong of Song could not burn out this dragon vein; in the fireworks of Tangming Town, Taiyuan folk stacked new ramparts anew. The wind bells of Shuangta Temple sway with Ming-Qing dreams, while glass towers mirror the light of tomorrow.\nHere are the financial memories of the Jin Merchants Museum, and the modern skyline of the Changfeng Business District. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center supports China’s spaceflight; new carbon-fiber materials have broken foreign monopolies. The Shitai, Tongpu, and Taijiao trunk railways converge here, reviving this national integrated transport hub. This “capital of vinegar,” where history joins modernity, now flaunts the charm of “Tang airs and Jin rhythms, brocade-bright Taiyuan,” reviving the old boast of “the Heavenly King’s three capitals—this, the northern one.” No longer just an energy symbol on a map: as high-speed lines stitch north to south and patents from “Jinchuang Valley” travel the world, the Dragon City will shrug off the coal narrative and write a new legend on the loess.\n\n\n“So long as Taiyuan can be held—name your price and I’ll pay it!”"

  City_View_desc_29: "Xi’an, commanding the Guanzhong Plain and nourished by the Wei River for millennia, etched a brilliant chapter as a “capital of thirteen dynasties.” From the painted pottery of Banpo to the ritual music of Fenghao in the Western Zhou, from the grandeur of the Qin–Han empires to the splendid chapters of High Tang—this starting point of the ancient Silk Road hears the morning and evening of the Bell and Drum Towers echo the bustling sweep of “Chang’an’s broad avenue reaching into myriad lanes,” while sutra scrolls of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda attest to Xuanzang’s westward feat of culture.\nHere the Longhai Railway crosses the Xi’an–Chengdu HSR; steel torrents of Shaanxi heavy trucks roll forth; rockets leap from the Aerospace Base; and culture–tourism blends in the Qujiang New District—making this national central city a key node of the Belt and Road. The calligraphic treasures of the Stele Forest sustain a living tradition, while the market smoke of the Muslim Quarter wafts with Silk Road flavors. Ancient and young at once, Xi’an—“Millennia-Old Capital, Come Often to Chang’an”—reanimates the open bearing of “envoys from myriad lands bowing before the tasseled crown,” a spiritual emblem of cultural confidence and a fresh chapter in the Western Development strategy.\n\n\nSo… when will the subway finally reach Northwestern Polytechnical University?"

In ravines of yellow earth and the coursing of red lifeblood, this revolutionary holy land raised an immortal spiritual monument. As the cradle of the Chinese Revolution, every yaodong cave bears the marks of struggle; people of Yan’an never blame poor soil—only believe that sweat can water good days.\nYan’an millet is fragrant far and wide; red tourism leads the nation; carbon-sink trading explores pathways to make ecology enrich the people. From the bold thunder of the Ansai waist drum to the folk craft in Yan’an’s fabric collages, from the down-to-earth taste of mushroom noodles to the mountains’ gift of Huanglong walnuts—this city, where red culture blends with loess folkways, with the unique appeal of “Holy Yan’an, Spiritual Homeland,” carries the “Yan’an style” down the road of rural revitalization, an era window on the Communist spirit.\n\n\nMy name is Yan’an.

This “millennia-old battleground that every strategist must contest” has written a surging chronicle through alternating war and peace.\nXCMG’s global footprint expands; innovation energy hums in Huaihai Science & Technology City; the Beijing–Shanghai HSR and the Longhai Railway cross at right angles. The “capital of construction machinery” is known worldwide; the Zero-Waste City program leads a new environmental ethos; the International Garden Expo showcases ecological transition. As the core of the Huaihai Economic Zone, Xuzhou keeps a civic character of “feeling and loyalty,” and with the unique grace of “Chu Charms and Han Style, landscapes of Xuzhou,” it takes the lead—an exemplar of revitalizing China’s old industrial bases.\n\n\n“In Xuzhou’s fields, across the dynasties, great wars—more than fifty.

Nanjing keeps a broad-minded, humanistic poise of “embracing all streams,” building an innovation city of global influence within Delta integration.\nThe chip industry in Jiangbei New Area is rewriting China’s “short of chips, few displays”; the smart-grid equipment cluster in Jiangning Development Zone holds global market share. Today’s Nanjing is crafting new legends. From the martyrs’ group sculpture at Yuhuatai to the red memories in the Crossing-of-the-Yangtze Victory Memorial, this ancient-young city—with the dual allure of “innovative city, beautiful ancient capital”—now presents a Nanjing of “strong, prosperous, beautiful, and high” on the new journey of national modernization.\n\n\n“I will return to Nanjing… to the capital I raised with my own hands… and this time… it will make me happy!”"

Across 2,500 years, this “paradise on earth” has perfectly embodied the immortal praise, “Above there is heaven; below, Suzhou and Hangzhou.” From when Wu Zixu “surveyed land and tasted waters” to raise King Helü’s great city, to the Ming–Qing prosperity of “when Su and Hu ripen, the realm has enough,” the old city still keeps its “water-and-land in parallel, rivers beside streets” double-grid plan.\nToday, Suzhou is home to Fortune Global 500 firms like Hengli and Shenghong, and to the innovation engine of Suzhou Industrial Park; it boasts a “China Pharma Valley” in biomedicine and a global high ground in nanotech. Suzhou keeps a civic character of “revering letters and wise discernment,” building a future-facing “modern international metropolis” through high-quality growth.\nThe industrial internet now “looks to Suzhou”; the city’s roster on the STAR Market keeps expanding; value added by core digital-economy industries accounts for over 15% of GDP. In this city where classic and modern fuse perfectly—“Paradise on Earth, Free and Easy Suzhou”—a new picture of “strong, prosperous, beautiful, and high” emerges within Yangtze Delta integration, an important window on Chinese-style modernization.\n\n\nSuzhou does have Meiyou Airport—but this is TFR: Suzhou has eaten Wuxi and Changzhou, so now it has two airports!

  City_View_desc_34: "Yancheng lies on China’s eastern seaboard beside the Yellow Sea, a land entirely of plains. It has the largest land area in Jiangsu and the province’s largest tidal-flat wetlands, and it is one of the world’s internationally recognized wetland cities. True to Jiangsu characteristics, its administration consists of three urban districts, five counties, and one county-level city (locals will tell you the pattern feels, well, a bit fragmented).\nYancheng’s modern industrial system grows steadily across next-generation information technology, new energy, artificial intelligence, third-generation semiconductors, cutting-edge new materials, and digital audio-visuals. In high-end manufacturing it stands out: crystalline-silicon photovoltaics and wind-power equipment remain among the national leaders.\nBecause many Yancheng people work in Shanghai, the city is often called “Little Shanghai.” In Dafeng District there are three “Shanghai Farms.” Koreans favor Yancheng as well, and the city has a resident Korean community and a base of Korean companies and factories—earning the nickname “the Koreans’ second hometown.”\n\n\nTough luck: on an ultra-flat plain—and still no subway."

  City_View_desc_35: "This “first modern city of China,” at the confluence of the Yangtze and the sea, has written a singular chapter of openness. Across a millennium since its founding in the Five Dynasties, from Zhang Jian’s “saving the nation through industry” and the creation of the Dasheng Cotton Mill to China’s first modern experiment in urban planning, Nantong has stood at the crest of each era’s tide. As a standout of river–sea culture, the emerald waters of the Hao River encircle well-preserved Ming–Qing historic quarters.\nEvery inch of this city crackles with innovation: the Nantong Innovation District gathers high-end platforms such as Peking University’s Yangtze River Delta Institute of Optoelectronics; the Haimen Biopharmaceutical Science Park has nurtured multiple Class-I new drugs; and its offshore wind installations in the East China Sea rank among the nation’s leaders. Today, Nantong is crafting new legends—Nantong-made ships and offshore engineering equipment account for over one-third of China’s market; high-end textiles have exceeded 200 billion yuan in scale; and new-generation information technologies are rising fast.\nBlending tradition with modernity, “Jewel of River and Sea, Graceful Nantong” shows new vigor in building a “strong, prosperous, beautiful, and high-standard” Jiangsu, becoming a key window on China’s open development along river and coast.\n“Those born under heaven are no different from grass and trees; if we can leave behind one or two useful enterprises, we will not decay like grass and trees.”\n\n\nI’m Nantong, not “nan-tong” (gay men)!

This “Zou-Lu of the Southeast” has written its own chapter through a deep mercantile tradition and ceaseless enterprise. In the 2,200-plus years since King Zou Yao of Eastern Ou founded the city, the Yongjia School’s practical creed of “affairs and merit” took root, nurturing the Wenzhou spirit of “daring to be first.”\nThis “Zhejiang Iron Triangle” is a key hinge linking the Yangtze River Delta with the West Coast Economic Zone. From intangible-heritage crafts of Ou embroidery and molded lacquerware to the fashion light industry of “Made-in-Wenzhou,” from the lingering southern tones of Yongjia kunqu to the global web of Wenzhou merchants: Liushi Town, “China’s capital of electrical equipment,” makes over a hundred billion yuan a year; the “China Shoe Capital” turns out a quarter of the nation’s footwear. The “Wenzhou Model” finds new life in the digital era.\nAs a pioneer zone of reform and opening, Wenzhou keeps telling the contemporary tale of “see the private economy—see Wenzhou.” From “front-shop, back-factory” to global Wenshang networks; from “quality builds the city” to “brands strengthen the city”—with the spirit of “dare to lead, especially able to build,” Wenzhou shows the world the vigor of China’s market economy.

Once the “first commandery of Jianghuai,” it holds the upright breeze of Lord Bao’s honesty and the smoky memory of “old battlefields” at Xiaoyao Ford. The University of Science and Technology of China shines like a beacon, driving the city’s sci-tech pulse; on Science Island, researchers probe the secrets of quantum; and the quest for an “artificial sun” pursues a star-bright dream.

Once the foremost of “China’s four great rice markets,” its ten-li street, all oars and lantern light, distills memories of Jiangnan’s trading glory. Sparks of modern industry caught flame here: Chery cars rolled from Wuhu to the world, a pride of China’s homegrown brands; and EFT’s precise robotic steps sketch the blueprint of a “smart-manufacturing city.” Fantawild’s parks light wonder; Zhe Mountain’s rosy mists and Mirror Lake’s willows nurture the city’s grace. Shrimp-roe noodles steam at Geng Fuxing; the savory of “Fool’s Sunflower Seeds” drifts through alleys—an unmistakable river-city flavor. With river-to-sea reach, pioneering pluck, an upgrade to smart industry, and a livable harmony of mountains and waters, Wuhu plays a symphony where tradition and modernity surge together on the rolling Wanjiang.\n\n\nYou keep shouting “Wuhu—take off!”, but—newsflash—Wuhu actually has an airport now."

The surging Huai grants it a north–south hinge; with the port’s revival and the high-speed web, the Pearl City is reviving the bustle of the “first great port on the Huai.” An early industrial base of New China, it is home to the China Architectural Glass & Industrial Glass Association’s design institute—glinting with the craftlight of a “glass city”; firms like Fengyuan press forward on the biomanufacturing track. Across the river, Mount Jing faces Mount Tu, and the legend of Yu the Great cleaving mountains to guide the Huai still echoes, nourishing the city’s cultural root. Hot, flaky sesame buns stuffed with crispy pork scent the streets; Huaiyuan pomegranates, plump and sweet, carry the mellow taste of the northern Anhui plain. As a key node on the Huai River Ecological Economic Belt, Bengbu—through convenient transport, industrial transition, and deep heritage—sets old industry glowing anew along this oft-battered yet vibrant riverscape.\n\n\nBengbu… can’t hold it in any longer."

Over 3,500 years of urban history have written the “River City’s” epic: the Yellow Crane Tower sings the verses of Cui Hao and Li Bai; Hanzheng Street stages the legend that “goods arriving in Hankou come alive”; and the gunshots of the Wuchang Uprising announced the end of imperial rule, forging the revolutionary monument of “Wuhan calls, the nation answers.”\nHere the Beijing–Guangzhou HSR meets the Yangtze’s golden waterway, making this national central city a vital node in the “dual-circulation” strategy; “Optics Valley of China” gathers a world-class optoelectronics industry; the National Memory Base breaks through chokepoint technologies; and the China–Europe Railway Express (Wuhan) links the Eurasian landmass. With the street-smoke of hot-dry noodles and the classic cookery of Wuchang fish, this city where tradition meets modernity—“a city of history, a city of the future”—keeps writing its River-City chapter."

The rolling river bears a thousand-year lineage for a city named for its starry constellations; at Yuelu Mountain Academy, the dictum “Only Chu produces talents” passes from torch to torch. This was a holy ground of China’s revolution—Mao Zedong studied, grew, and organized here; his youthful statue on Orange Isle watches over the land even now. It is also a powerhouse of Chinese manufacturing—“capital of construction machinery” is no idle boast; several top engineering universities are rooted here, and the giant machines of Zoomlion, SANY, and Sunward stride across the globe. On Pozi Street, Fire Palace’s stinky tofu and sugar-oil rice cakes steam with flavor; on Jiefang West, neon lights the starry nights. On the soil of Huxiang, Changsha keeps marching with the spirit of “concern for all under heaven, daring to be first.”\n\n\nTianxin Pavilion, a pavilion with doves—doves fly; the pavilion stays.\nOrange Isle, an isle with boats—boats move; the isle does not."

Jiangling builds modern automobiles; the Aviation Industrial City sends eagles to the sky; and the Ganjiang New Area radiates openness and vitality. Keeping a spirit broad and open, Nanchang takes the lead in Jiangxi’s rise.

Two thousand years of ceramic firing, a thousand of official kilns, six hundred of imperial kilns—layer on layer of mastery.\nJingdezhen keeps an open heart of “craftspeople come from all quarters; wares go to all under heaven.” As the National Ceramic Culture Inheritance & Innovation Pilot Zone, it is restoring the luster of the contemporary Porcelain Capital. The aesthetic of “white as jade, bright as a mirror, thin as paper, and ringing like a chime” is a porcelain rhapsody drawn stroke by stroke by Jingdezhen’s hands.

  City_View_desc_54: "Waters of the Nanliu River washed over ancient names from Sui–Tang—Yulin Commandery to Yulin Prefecture—and today a hub of southeastern Guangxi. Each renaming etched a ring in time. This \"millennial old prefecture\" forged a \"Lingnan fine-jade\" temperament in culture and commerce: the woodcarving of Yuntian Cultural City shows a grand gallery of Lingnan art; the suspended-pillar wonder of Zhenwu Pavilion displays southern architectural genius; and the wind-turbine arrays on Mount Darong write a new chapter of green development.\nYuchai’s \"Xinlan\" new-energy powertrains go global; Amer International’s new-materials project fills a Guangxi supply-chain gap; and as the \"Fragrance Capital of the South,\" the spice industry takes 70% of China’s market—making this \"Guangxi East-Integration Demonstration Zone\" a forward gateway to the Greater Bay Area. As Guangxi’s largest homeland of overseas Chinese, Yulin is composing a contemporary legend of a Lingnan metropolis—from \"millennial Yulin\" to \"modern mart,\" from \"city of crafts\" to \"advanced-manufacturing base\"—with a pioneer spirit that showcases southeastern Guangxi’s rise. On this hotbed of enterprise, it strides toward a modern new Yulin strong in industry, hubs, ecology, rule of law, and rural revitalization.\n\n\nYulin Dog Meat Festival! Come try dog meat!"

  City_View_55: "Guilin"
  City_View_desc_55: "Guilin rests by the Lijiang at the southern end of the Xiang–Gui Corridor. As the living original of Chinese ink landscapes, Elephant Trunk Hill’s moon on the river embodies the poetic sign of \"Guilin scenery\"; the terraced waves of Longji Rice Terraces compose an epic of agrarian civilization. This city has watered countless verses with its mountains and rivers—and withstood the weight of war in flesh and blood.\nToday’s Guilin pairs the modern industry of a deep-tech intelligent-manufacturing park with the cloud engines of a Huawei data center; it pilots ecology in a UN 2030 Agenda innovation demo zone, and writes a new \"Guilin Classics\" chapter in culture–tourism fusion. Where the Guiyang–Guangzhou HSR crosses the Xiang–Gui Railway, this international tourist magnet links the GBA to China’s southwest. With an open, inclusive, and pioneering stance, it moves toward a world-class tourist city—economically vibrant, urb-rural flourishing, civically cultured, ecologically sound, livable, and happy.\n\n\nAmong landscapes, Guilin is first under heaven!"

  City_View_56: "Haikou"
  City_View_desc_56: "Waters of the Nandu River scour the shores of the Qiongzhou Strait; folds of volcanic rock hide a heat from ten millennia past. This is the \"end of the earth\" from Su Shi’s verse, an ancient outpost on the Maritime Silk Road. The \"Coconut City\" composes a \"South China Sea pearl\" of tropical charm and reform-opening verve, while ten-thousand-ton ferries on the strait attest to China’s largest special economic zone’s openness.\nBiopharma at Qilu Pharma, the digital economy at Fuxing City Internet Park, Free Trade Port construction in Jiangdong New Area, and culture–tourism on the West Coast—Haikou keeps a special-zone spirit of \"venture to the sea\" and leads Hainan Free Trade Port development. As the capital of China’s youngest province, Haikou writes a contemporary chapter of that spirit: from \"ends of the earth\" to \"open frontier,\" from \"national-defense outpost\" to \"international gateway,\" it shows the vigor of China’s largest reform test field. On this soil of innovation and enterprise, Haikou—with openness, inclusiveness, and striving vitality—moves toward a modern, international new Haikou.\n\n\nCoconut Palm brand coconut juice—I’ve been drinking it since I was little."
  
  City_View_57: "Xishuangbanna"
  City_View_desc_57: "Xishuangbanna lies along the Lancang (Mekong) River—the only true oasis on the Tropic of Cancer. The river’s flow once traced the borders of the “Twelve Banna,” and the smoke curling from Dai bamboo houses twines with the crowns of the rainforest. This is “Mengbalanaxi.” In the embrace of tropical jungle and many-ethnic culture, this “ideal and wondrous haven” has composed a jeweled poem of its own. The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences tends 13,000 living plant species; the Jinuo village preserves the culture of China’s last-confirmed ethnic group; and the thousand-year “village heart tree” in the Dai Ethnic Park guards the faith of the “people like water.” “Rainforest tourism” now welcomes over 40 million visits a year. This ecological secret realm, where nature and culture meet, advances as “Magical, Beautiful Xishuangbanna,” writing a new peacock-feathered chapter in a national demonstration zone for ethnic unity and progress.\nWhen night falls and the Lancang–Mekong Night song-and-dance show lights up the border stars, this enchanted city, with openness and harmony, strides toward a world-class tourist destination and a key growth pole for Yunnan.\n\n\nThe elephants here really will come give you a back stomp."

  City_View_58: "Kunming"
  City_View_desc_58: "Kunming sits on the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau by Dian Lake—“the Spring City,” where mild sun and a mosaic of cultures have painted the brilliant canvas of the “Floral Capital of Asia.” A rail web that branches “eight ways to other provinces and five out to foreign borders,” together with Changshui International Airport, makes this regional international center a pivotal node in the Belt and Road.\nAs one of China’s first National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities, Kunming is renewing the contemporary chapter of a “highland pearl.” From “frontier of the southwest” to “leading edge of openness,” from the narrow-gauge era to the high-speed era, Kunming—with an inclusive heart—shows the world a living practice of modernization in a multi-ethnic borderland. This city of springlike weather advances toward a regional international hub rooted in the Southwest, serving all of China, and radiating to South and Southeast Asia.\n\n\nWe really don’t eat wild mushrooms. Kunhua Hospital’s toxicology ranks among the world’s best—anyone got a pig head?"

  City_View_59: "Kangding"
  City_View_desc_59: "Capital of Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, this “hometown of the love song” sits where the Tea–Horse Road and Han–Tibetan exchange forged a “pearl of the snowland.” Seven-Colored Lake at Mugecuo shifts with the enchantments of highland waters; Yala Snow Mountain rises solemn over the Tagong meadows; and the first gate on the Sichuan–Tibet route draws over ten million visitors a year. With the wisdom of “harmonious co-existence,” Kangding shows the world how ethnic regions can thrive.\nHere you’ll find both the green development of lithium resources and the distinctive economy of yak industries; both culture–tourism in the “first city on the Dadu River” and ecological stewardship across the Northwest Sichuan demonstration zone. Where the Sichuan–Tibet Railway will meet National Highway 318, this gateway to the “Shangri-La core area” is an essential hinge linking China’s heartland and Tibet. In this sacred highland where cultures interlace, “Hometown of the Love Song · Romantic Kangding” is composing a “snowland pastoral” of rural revitalization and ecological care.\n\n\n“In my home there’s someone cool—so badass he needs no school. His pipe’s a little thick; it stands there, damn, like a tree.”"

  City_View_60: "Chengdu"
  City_View_desc_60: "Counted among China’s happiest cities, Chengdu has charted a path from “two rivers in an embrace” to a “cross-axis strategy,” from a “capital of leisure” to a “city of innovation.” At the strategic crossroads of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Silk Road Economic Belt, Chengdu has both the J-20’s aviation industry and BOE’s high-end manufacturing; both the growth engine of Tianfu New Area and the open platform of the International Railway Port. Ever comfortably “bashi,” the city advances with innovation, openness, and inclusion toward goals of a national central city, a beautiful livable park city, an international gateway hub, and a world cultural capital.\n\n\nAround here, Chenghua Avenue seems like the only straight line."

  City_View_61: "Guiyang"
  City_View_desc_61: "The name “Guiyang” dates to the Ming. Through Yuan and Ming it was known as Guizhou; across the ages its industries bear the marks of their times and a drive to innovate. In recent years, Guiyang has leaned hard into big data—core of China’s first National Big Data Comprehensive Pilot Zone—and earned the name “China’s Data Valley.” That surge has lifted allied sectors, forming a robust industrial chain.\nOver its long history, the city has forged a spirit of openness, resilience, and drive—visible in wartime grit and today’s inventive growth. A National Civilized City, a National Hygienic City, and among China’s Happiest Cities, Guiyang has notched real gains in urban civility.\n\n\n“Bro, Huaguoyuan’s got a ‘White House’ too, yeah?”"

  City_View_62: "Jiuquan"
  City_View_desc_62: "Once called “Suzhou,” Jiuquan took its name when, under Emperor Wu of Han, General Huo Qubing “poured wine into a spring and drank with his troops.” Since the Western Han set up Jiuquan Commandery, it has guarded a Silk Road choke point, witness to the meeting of East and West—nearby stand the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, Yang Pass, and Jade Gate Pass. Wang Wei’s lines—“a lone plume of smoke in the desert straight; the long river, round, with setting sun”—capture its vastness.\nJiuquan is cradle of China’s spaceflight: since 1958, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (Dongfeng Space City) has lofted the Shenzhou crewed missions and more. Yumen Oilfield nearby marks the birth of New China’s petroleum industry. In modern agriculture, Jiuquan is China’s largest base for seed production of vegetables and flowers, while gobi agriculture and new energy (wind, PV) power ahead.\n\n\nCome watch a launch."

  City_View_63: "Lanzhou"
  City_View_desc_63: "Lanzhou sits at the geometric center of China’s landmass, the Yellow River running through a landscape of “two mountains holding one river.” At about 1,520 meters elevation, it has a temperate continental climate—no bitter winter, no scorching summer, an annual average of 11.2 °C—earning the title “China’s summer retreat capital.”\nIt is the Northwest’s key center of industry, transport, and science—strong in petrochemicals, equipment manufacturing, and biopharma. Lanzhou New Area, the Northwest’s first national-level new area, is upgrading the region’s economy. A multimodal hub of rail, road, and air, Lanzhou assembles China–Europe freight trains, and Zhongchuan International Airport links major domestic and foreign cities. Nurtured by the Yellow River, this millennia-old city is renewing its Silk Road luster with industrial revival and culture–tourism fusion.\n\n\n“Lanzhou ‘lamian’ is heresy! Beef noodles are the real deal!”"

  City_View_64: "Yinchuan"
  City_View_desc_64: "Irrigation from the Yellow River gave Yinchuan its “half city of lakes and half city of views”—nearly 200 lakes and wetlands—and in 2018 it was among the world’s first designated “International Wetland Cities,” long praised as a “Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall.”\nA rising industrial city of the Northwest and a Belt and Road node, Yinchuan has built out energy–chemicals, equipment manufacturing, and wine among its pillar sectors. New districts drive upgrading; China–Europe trains and a cross-border e-commerce pilot zone widen its openness. With the Yinxi and Yinlan high-speed lines and Hedong International Airport, connectivity is strong. Multiplicity is its signature: Western Xia heritage, Yellow River culture, Hui traditions, and frontier verse meet here. From Helan Mountain rock art (intangible heritage) to hand-pulled mutton, Yinchuan shows a hospitable spirit—festivals like “Under Helan Mountain” give tradition a modern voice.\n\n\nYinchuan isn’t Incheon—mixing up your plane tickets would be something else."

  City_View_65: "Xining"
  City_View_desc_65: "Xining, capital of Qinghai, lies in the Huangshui Valley on the northeastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, average elevation 2,261 m—the plateau’s only million-plus metropolis. Once “Xiping Commandery” and “Qingtang City,” its name wishes “peace on the western frontier.” Gateway on the Southern Silk Road and the Tang–Tubo corridor, it long bridged trade and culture among the Central Plains, the Western Regions, and Tibet.\nAs a Belt and Road node, Xining focuses on lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and biomedicine, expanding outward-oriented industry; products like solar cells and Tibetan carpets sell worldwide. “Hua’er” folk songs and the richly layered Hehuang culture add intangible depth; specialties like hand-held mutton, sweet barley ferment (tianpei), and “dog-pee fritters” are unforgettable. Culture–tourism is building the “Snow Leopard Capital” IP; eco-tourism and sporting events are lifting the city’s profile.\n\n\nLanzhou lamian was “born in Qinghai,” you know—but I still prefer sheep-intestine noodles."

  City_View_66: "Lhasa"
  City_View_desc_66: "Lhasa, capital of Tibet Autonomous Region, sits slightly southeast of central Tibet on the north bank of the Lhasa River, a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo. At ~3,650 m, it is among the world’s highest cities. With a cool, semi-arid plateau monsoon climate and 3,000+ hours of sun yearly, it is famed as the “City of Sunlight.”\nA sacred center of Tibetan Buddhism, it is home to the Potala Palace, Barkhor Street, and more; Tibetan opera and the Shoton Festival enrich its intangible heritage. A multi-ethnic city with Tibetans at roughly 78.4%, religion and folkways weave a distinct highland human landscape. The Qinghai–Tibet Railway and the Sichuan–Tibet Highway span the region, powering growth. Tourism thrives—Potala, Jokhang and other World Heritage sites draw visitors from around the globe—and in 1982 Lhasa entered the first cohort of National Historic and Cultural Cities.\n\n\nOnce said to be the oldest demon-king citadel from the age of myth; a little over half a century ago, an Eastern hero led the jinzhumami (PLA soldiers) to liberate it—now it’s a landscape for all the people to see at their leisure."

  City_View_67: "Urumqi"
  City_View_desc_67: "Ancient “Dihua,” Urumqi fell under the Western Regions Protectorate in the Western Han; the Tang set up Luntai; in Qianlong’s reign it was formally named Dihua as Xinjiang’s military–administrative center. When Xinjiang became a province in 1884, Dihua was the capital; in 1954 it was renamed Urumqi—Mongolian for “beautiful pasture.” A strongpoint on the Silk Road, it has long seen East–West trade and culture mesh.\nToday it is the Northwest’s key economic and transport hub, famed as the “Heart of Asia.” Home to many peoples—Han, Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, and more—it showcases rich cultures from Uyghur music and dance to Kazakh horse racing. As a core Belt and Road city, its Free Trade Pilot Zone powers foreign trade; pillars include energy–chemicals, equipment manufacturing, and new energy, while the international logistics network centers on Diwopu International Airport.\n\n\n“Urumqi… Uru-no-banner-qi, Bird-lumqi, Murk-lumqi…” (say it right!)"

  City_View_68: "Taipei"
  City_View_desc_68: "Taipei is Taiwan’s center of economy, finance, and technology. Xinyi Planning District is the commercial core, and Taipei 101 once topped the world. Transit is dense—the Metro web, Taoyuan International Airport’s global links, and high-speed rail up the island’s spine. Tech runs on semiconductors and electronics, with Neihu Science Park a key innovation base. In recent years, smart-city and green-energy policies have aimed to lift global competitiveness.\nHuman history here reaches back to the Paleolithic; large-scale settlement by immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong began in the 18th century. The walled city rose in the late 19th century as an administrative center. After 1895, under Japanese rule, Taipei became the colonial core. In 1945 the island was restored; after 1949 it grew into the political, economic, and cultural center of Taiwan. Elevated to a special municipality in 1967, since 1990 it has had today’s 12 districts.\n\n\n“From Taipei a band of friends—built huts in Lanyu Village;\nfrom Lanyu a band of friends—built huts on Little Lanyu.”"
