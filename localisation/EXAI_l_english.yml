  EXPRC_event.1.t: "Japan Lands on Our Key Islands"
  EXPRC_event.1.d: "At 03:21 this morning, radar stations guarding several of our key islands detected large-scale electronic interference. Backup communications also reported enemy swarms of UAVs and AEW aircraft approaching. At the same time, under escort from numerous frigates, hundreds of Japanese amphibious landing craft brazenly pushed into the waters off our Diaoyu Islands, the Nansha (Spratly) Islands, and other critical island groups, launching heavy air strikes and naval bombardments while dispatching massed landing troops to storm the beaches. The People’s Liberation Army garrisons on the islands responded swiftly under the furious assault of the Japanese aggressors, rapidly organizing before our air support arrived, constructing island defenses, and delivering a staunch counterattack that blunted the arrogance of Japanese imperialism. This is Japan’s largest seaborne landing raid against our country since the end of the Second World War, aimed at seizing vital island-based radar and naval/air bases so as to gain strike and intelligence advantages in the East and South China Seas—extending their claws toward our vital coastal regions and other Southeast Asian nations."
  EXPRC_event.1.a: "Such brazen aggression will not be tolerated!"

  EXPRC_event.2.t: "Japan Launches Ultra–Large-Scale Landings in Southeast Asia"
  EXPRC_event.2.d: "Since Taiwan’s return to the motherland, Japan has raced to carry out massive island-building and land reclamation near our East and South China Seas, erecting extensive military facilities and deploying large forces, and has conducted repeated large live-fire exercises near our territorial waters. Less than half a month after Japan invaded our key islands, it expanded deployments across Southeast Asian archipelagos and, in [GetMonth] of this year, executed ultra–large-scale landing operations against Southeast Asian countries. To date, Japan has committed thousands of amphibious landing craft, hundreds of missile cruisers and frigates, and delivered hundreds of armored divisions within a single month to major cities and ports across the region—at least including the capitals of Singapore, Jakarta, Bangkok, and Manila—while countless early landings hit additional ports. Many online military analysts and bloggers had predicted Taiwan would be Japan’s first landing target, yet Japan bypassed Taiwan to strike Southeast Asia at scale. This bold and extreme move will no doubt push Southeast Asian nations fully toward us, but it also forces us to divide our forces to protect allies. The scale of these landings is unprecedented in human history, profoundly shaking global perceptions of Japan’s military power and allowing currents of defeatism to spread rapidly among elites in Southeast Asia and among some of our grassroots. Our tomorrow faces an unprecedented storm—an extraordinarily severe test for the Party, the nation, the military, and the people."
  EXPRC_event.2.a: "From here on, we must §Rface hardship head-on§!."

  EXPRC_event.3.t: "Japan Conducts Large-Scale Landings on Our Taiwan"
  EXPRC_event.3.d: "On August 1, 1894, the feeble Qing dynasty saw its gates broken by Japanese imperialism. The First Sino–Japanese War shattered the mighty Beiyang Fleet and smashed the reformers’ gains, culminating in the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki on April 17, 1895. For fifty years thereafter, Taiwan lay under the shadow of Japanese imperialism, until the end of the War of Resistance when the Chinese people freed Taiwan from Japan’s clutches. In the small hours today, Japanese imperialism dispatched hundreds of warships to launch a fierce assault around our Taiwan Island, covering massed landings across the entire island. All of China—and indeed the world—now watches this decisive battle. For our country, we must use this campaign to crush the arrogance of Japanese imperialism and to declare to the world that the era of the Chinese people being oppressed is gone forever. Today’s China is not the frail Qing court, but a unified and powerful New China!"
  EXPRC_event.3.a: "Eastern Theater Command, prepare to engage!"

  EXPRC_event.4.t: "Japan Executes Ultra–Large-Scale Landings Along Our Entire Coastline"
  EXPRC_event.4.d: "At the beginning of [GetYear] [GetMonth], Japanese imperialism launched a sudden, unprecedented assault along our long coastline. In key economic regions—Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta—the scale of forces was especially immense. Our People’s Liberation Army fought heroically in self-defense, mounting a resolute counterattack to safeguard our sacred territory. News of Japan’s invasion ignited righteous fury nationwide. Tide upon tide of protesters surged into the streets to denounce the armed incursion, while enlistment offices across the country were packed to bursting. China roars—1.4 billion Chinese roar! “Down with Japanese imperialism!” “Down with Japanese fascism!” After eighty-four long years, these slogans once again ring out across the land. China’s sacred territory must never be violated. Should Japanese imperialism dare to reach out its hand, the Chinese people will smash it to pieces, leaving not a single shard of armor! Clowns of Japanese imperialism—open your eyes and see: the age of bullying the Chinese people has ended. If you dare test the iron ramparts of our great motherland, 1.4 billion Chinese will bury you completely!"
  EXPRC_event.4.a: "§RThe Chinese nation has reached its most perilous hour§!"

  EXPRC_event.5.t: "Japan Mounts Large-Scale Landings Against Our Developed Coastal Regions"
  EXPRC_event.5.d: "Since Japan began ultra-large-scale landings along our coast, our military and civilians have stood as one, stubbornly blocking the invaders’ advance. With guerrilla harassment and the PLA’s valor, we have gradually retaken numerous key ports and cities, driving Japanese imperialism from the sacred soil and smashing their fantasy of a full-scale invasion. Confronted with heavy defeats, ballooning military expenditures, and rising discontent among the masses, Japan’s top fascists have tried a desperate gambit—launching another major strike in [GetYear] [GetMonth] against our key economic regions of Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta. But today’s Japanese army is no longer at its zenith. The nation, the military, and the people will utterly crush this scheme to cloak internal contradictions with external victories, and will expose the true face of Japanese fascism to the peoples of Japan, China, and the entire world!"

  EXPRK_event.1.t: "DPRK Nuclear Warning to the Tai Pact"
  EXPRK_event.1.d: "KCNA Pyongyang dispatch — Under the shameless aggression of the evil Japanese imperialists and the Southern puppet regime, and with our people’s sovereign territory gravely violated, our Republic had no choice, under the order of the great Comrade Chairman Kim Jong Un, but to launch nuclear weapons embodying the wrath of the Korean army and people at the evil Japanese imperialists and Southern puppet swine. Yet under the leadership of the great Comrade Chairman Kim Jong Un, the Korean army and people love peace, and fully understand that this shameful war of aggression was launched by the Japanese imperialists and the Southern reactionary regime against the voices of peace-loving peoples in both countries. The Korean army and people stand in a united front with the peoples of Japan and the South against their reactionary governments. Our nuclear counterstrike here is a warning: if our national sovereignty continues to be infringed and our people harmed, the next nuclear strike will target the two lairs of reaction—the capitals Tokyo and Seoul—aimed at the Blue House and the National Diet. Japan’s militarists and the ROK puppets, the thousand-year nemeses of the Korean people, must understand that the front line they dare approach will become a miserable grave from which they will never rise again."
  EXPRK_event.1.a: "The fuse of the Korean Peninsula powder keg has been lit after all."

  EXAI_event.1.t: "§RRising Sun Empire§! Difficulty Tips"
  EXAI_event.1.d: "1. On the eve of the §RGreat Asia War§!, Japan can field over 1,500 armored divisions; at the peak during the §RGreat Asia War§! it can exceed 2,500 divisions. Japanese divisions are §Rstrong on offense§! but have §Ylow HP§!. In the first year, Japan’s “Martian” divisions cycle very fast—achieving a quick victory in year one is nearly impossible. Best practice is to delay and launch a large counteroffensive in year two.\n\n2. Japan’s navy builds much faster, focusing on missile destroyers and light frigates. A single Japanese ship is not worlds apart from a post-reform §BPeople’s Navy§!. To defeat it, mass all fleets and defeat the strong Japanese navy in detail. Remember—§Rarrogance leads to defeat§!. If decades of §BPeople’s Navy§! buildup are squandered, §Rno one can shoulder that responsibility!!!§!\n\n3. Landing on the Japanese home islands is a highly challenging operation. The PLA will face §Rfrantic counterattacks§! from home-defense divisions; a small mistake may mean an entire army group is wiped out! Concentrate §Gall favorable conditions§! to achieve §Goverwhelming local superiority§! and strike like Mount Tai!\n\n4. Japan’s early offensives will be §Rextremely ferocious§! and include §R“Martian division” landings§!. Prioritize §3anti-landing defenses§! against Japan.\n\n5. Early in the §RGreat Asia War§! Japan has a strong §Gbuff§! that weakens over time, eventually becoming a massive §Rdebuff§!. The names shift over time in this order: “Sun at Zenith,” “Like the Rising Sun,” “Sun Declining from the Zenith,” “Rivers and Suns Descend,” “Sun Sets Beyond the Western Hills.” Avoid Japan’s §Rsharp edge§! early; when the time is §Ymature§!, sound the counteroffensive!\n\n6. Do not underestimate Japan’s home-defense capacity. It’s best to plan major landings when Japan is in “Rivers and Suns Descend” or “Sun Sets Beyond the Western Hills.”"
  EXAI_event.1.a: "§RIf the people survive but the land is lost, both survive; if the land survives but the people are lost, both are lost.§!"

  EXAI_event.2.t: "§YBrahma’s Divine Army§! Difficulty Tips"
  EXAI_event.2.d: "1. Compared with Japan’s §Rhigh offense§!/§Ythin HP§!, Indian divisions have §Ythicker HP§!, so fights last longer.\n\n2. India’s air force is greatly strengthened. Pay close attention to aircraft counts within each air region. Underestimating enemy numbers or overestimating your quality will be costly. Let bombers prioritize enemy airfields and AA to削 reduce enemy air superiority.\n\n3. India’s §Roffensives§! in the early §RGreat Asia War§! will be fierce. Emphasize defense and do not lament a tile or two of lost ground—they will be §Rliberated§! again!\n\n4. Place many agents in India, especially along the Sino–Indian border, to cut India’s planning cap; otherwise the first month may see you unable to hold against India’s powerful push.\n\n5. Strategic bombers are hugely impactful; within two months they can nearly erase a nation’s infrastructure and industry. If your planes ‘vanish’ on airbases, it’s because enemy strategic bombing destroyed them. Likewise, ignore India’s strat bombing at your peril—your industry will be ravaged.\n\n6. Tibet receives a special “Plateau Region” modifier at this difficulty. You can reduce forces there and focus defenses in Yunnan/Guangxi instead.\n\n7. When India’s surrender progress is high, it will begin spawning high-quality “Martian” divisions. To take India, it’s advised to finish Japan and the rest of the Tai Pact first, then concentrate everything on India; otherwise you may sink into a protracted quagmire.\n\n\n\n"

  EXAI_event.3.d: "While playing “The Fire Rises” or the older “The Fire Rises: Hidden Dragon, Soaring Abyss,” you may have noticed that navy-related buffs—such as national spirits or dynamic modifiers—did not apply. This bug has long existed in “The Fire Rises.” Our team reported it to the official Chinese group in early April but received no constructive reply, so the Hidden Dragon team sought another path. In v1.927 (initial) of “The Fire Rises: Hidden Dragon, Soaring Abyss,” we moved all naval buffs into the military-industrial organizations to force them to apply as an emergency workaround. In the current version, with help from kind coder friends from the Autumnrise Library, our code team has fixed the root issue after reviewing the base game code; your naval buffs now work properly.\n\nWe thank all community friends—especially those from the Autumnrise Library—for your support and help, and hope “The Fire Rises” continues to improve.\n\nFinally, thank you for supporting “The Fire Rises: Hidden Dragon, Soaring Abyss!”"

  EXAI_event.4.d: "Because there are many combinations of difficulties and limited testing across them, please read decision prompts carefully before choosing, or you may have an unpleasant experience.\n\nMedium (you can line-advance with some effort): “Tai Pact Strengthen Tier 3” + “Shame and Courage” + “Remove all negative spirits from Tai Pact countries” counts as high within Medium. Adding “Four Crossings of the Red River” at start and +4 JPN/KOR/IND raises it to the top of Medium.\n\nHard (requires some defense early in the §RGreat Asia War§!; some Hard setups demand full focus and comprehensive early defense): On top of Medium, add options from “Strengthen India” and “Strengthen Japan.” The absolute hardest is enabling every strengthen option in those two (except “Rising Sun Empire” and “Brahma’s Divine Army”). With “Tai Pact Strengthen Tier 3” + “Shame and Courage” + “Remove all negative spirits,” enabling all difficulty options other than “Rising Sun Empire”/“Brahma’s Divine Army” is the maximum. This difficulty unlocks the highest-tier achievement."

  EXAI_event.5.d: "Kids, run! This isn’t Hidden Dragon—this is the freakin’ Full-Band Jamming 2030 worldline!!! No ‘Kick Dog’ here—only Big Dog, chomp chomp!\n\nTo prevent unsuspecting players from tilting on the top difficulty, read these notes before you play it. If you ignore this and tilt, please report to your local public security bureau.\n\n1) For this difficulty, you only need Japan’s “Rising Sun Empire” and India’s “Brahma’s Divine Army,” plus the base top-difficulty setup; other buffs matter less.\n\n2) In this mode, it’s possible to lose huge swaths of territory within six months—even fighting a Sichuan–Chongqing campaign. Early §RGreat Asia War§! gameplay is a prison: you’ll lose land faster than in “New East Asia,” and it’ll feel even worse—a true supermax. If your tolerance for pressure is low, do not choose the top difficulty! In testing we produced fronts worse than the historical War of Resistance, so think twice.\n\n3) Why so hard: the team plans for WWIII later, whose top difficulty should match the brutality of “Full-Band Jamming”—i.e., the failure state of the §RGreat Asia War§!. This version effectively gives JPN/IND ‘Trisolarian tech,’ front-loading much of WWIII’s difficulty into the §RGreat Asia War§!. If WWIII is made later, §RGreat Asia War§! difficulty will be reduced accordingly.\n\n4) Ideal top-difficulty arc: ~6 months strategic defense, ~6 months stalemate, then strategic counteroffensive. Thus the first year—especially the first half—is the harshest.\n\n5) Enabling top difficulty will likely break postwar scripts unless you can win the §RGreat Asia War§! within 8 months.\n\n6) Under “Rising Sun Empire,” Japan has “Martian division” landing events.\n\nThe Hard mode worldline differs completely from Hidden Dragon; it is the Full-Band Jamming 2030 worldline.

  EXAI_event.9.t: "On Hidden Dragon’s Model Issues"
  EXAI_event.9.d: "Certain TFR mod settings and lighting can cause new models from our team to have lighting issues and fail to preview in the designer; this is currently unsolved. They still display correctly on the game map.\n\nThe ZTZ-251 “Pixiu” previews normally in the designer.\n\nThe J-36 “Yulong” and Attack-14 “Anjian” do not preview in the designer. If the preview appears black when selecting, that means it is the J-36 or Anjian—safe to choose.\n\nOur exclusive models—J-36 “Yulong,” ZTZ-251 “Pixiu,” and Attack-14 “Anjian”—were produced by ‘59 Tank’ and licensed to the Hidden Dragon team. Copyright belongs to 59 Tank and the Hidden Dragon team. Unauthorized use or appropriation is prohibited and will be pursued for copyright and even legal liability."
